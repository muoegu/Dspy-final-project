My english is bad. Sorry. Chaplin was happily walking around without paying much attention at what was surrounding him, while he suddenly found a little baby crying out loud over the floor. The baby was covered inside some cloths and Chaplin didn't know about to do about him. Then, he saw a mother with his child far away, and he wondered that maybe she was also the mother of the child he found, so he gave the child to the woman saying that it was hers.\n",

I get a lot of feelings about the video, first because of the action that the main actor takes with the subject, and even more with the circumstances that come before him, but he decides to pick it up and hand it to somebody so that I care because I think that in his mind was that he could not have it for x and circumstance that will happen not knowing that in the end he would touch staying with him because they watched him not letting go of what he found; Nevertheless this makes much presence in our lives in occasions that finds people without waiting them that in the end one wants to remove them completely of our lives but that with actions that are incorporated within the moment does not let us let go until accepting the reality that is Is living. This short clip shows a funny man who finds an unknown baby in the middle of the street.

      "The movies were a great invention which I took advantage of to make an attempt of social conscience. Chaplin in his films denounced several injustices that existed at that time. His movies aside from spending a good time laughing, they have several subliminal messages about what society is like.\n",
      "In my opinion Chaplin is the best  comedic actor in the silenc film. The video tells a story about a missed child. A man was walking when he'd discovered a baby alone near of the rubbish. At the same moment he saw a woman carrying a trolly, so he thought that maybe she had missed him there. He tried to gave her the baby but she refused him. Then, the man got back to the rubbish and put him there again. But then, a police thought that he was leaving a baby alone, and he turned so angry. The man decided to toke the baby again and he gave it to an old man. The old man was so confused and when he saw a trolly, he put him in again. But the woman, the owner's trolly, didn't see the old man: She saw again the man of the beggining! She was so angry. She catched the man up and gave him the baby again. \n",
      "The man didn't know what to do. He sat down on the pavement, and when he was looking the baby, he discovered a note between his clothes. The note said: \"Please, love and care this orphan child\"\n",
      "The man understood everything: he couldn't leave him alone again. In the clip, we can see Charles Chapling having a walk around what seems to be a typical city seting. People are throwing rubbish out of their windows, and Mr. Chaplin gets hit twice by the falling rubbish. All of a sudden, he realises that there is something more than rubbish laying on the floor; there is an abandoned child. Confused, Mr. Chaplin, looks around to see if he can find the child's parents. When a lady who is carrying a pushchair  passes by, he assumes that the lady had lost or abandoned the child. When he hands the baby over to the lady, the lady reacts furiously, as the baby is not hers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disappointed, Mr. Chaplin decices to leave the baby back where it was, when he walks into a police officer, who stares at him when he sees Mr. Chaplin leaving a baby on the streets. Having changed his mind due to the presence of the angry-looking officer, he hands the baby to an anonymous man who he sees in a nearby street. The anonymous man then sees the lady with the pushchair and decides to leave the baby in it and run away. However, when the lady sees Mr. Chaplin again, she hands the baby back to him. \n",

      "Because of this, Charles cares for baby and they go away together This video starts with Chaplin walking by the street. Suddenly, he finds a baby on the floor. Chaplin is very surprised and feels the responsibility of taking the baby. After that, Chaplin realises that he can't stay with the poor baby so he tries to get rid of him by all the ways. Firstly, Chaplin sees a woman walking with her baby so he tries to put the baby on the carriage but the woman gets angry. Then, he tries to do the same action with  a man who is walking by the streets but he is again rejected. After many attempts, Chaplin sits on the street and finds a message  that makes him understand that the baby needs someone who loves him. At the begining it appears Charles Chaplin walking in a neighbourhood which seems to be poor. He stops for smoking when he hears something. It was a baby crying on the floor. A woman with her baby was passing by at that moment so Charles thinks is hers. The lady, upset, gives the baby back to him. As he doesn't know what to do with the child, Charles leaves the baby on the floor, where he found him but a policeman arrives and Chaplin takes the baby again. He manages to give the baby to a man who was walking on the street and this man finds the woman who Charles found at the begining with the baby.  The man drops the baby with that woman but unfortunately Chaplin was passing by at that moment so they begin a fight. Finally Charles finds a note which says that the baby is an orphan, so he decides to take that baby as it was his. In the film, we can see how Chaplin was walking around the street when suddenly he found a baby. When he discovered the child he was so surprised and wanted to look for her/his parents. Chaplin saw a mother with a baby chair and he pretended to put the baby there furthermore, the mother confused him with a baby thief. \n",
      "The day got worse and the police interviewed him about the baby. Tired of this situation he decided to abandon the baby when he discovered between her/his clothes a paper note with the message: love me, so he gets the baby with him. A man is walking freely and, suddenly, he finds a baby and he doesn't know what to do with him. He tries to understand what is happening, because he see that situation like an unreal one. Finally, after being troubled with a policeman and trying to quit the baby, trying to abandon him, he takes care of the infant because of a woman who refuses to protect the child, giving to him love and addopting him. At the beginning of the video, Chaplin appears dodging some kind of materials that are falling down. He walks towards the camera and suddenly, something falls over his head, he stops, look above and then, takes a box with cigarettes within from his pocket. He takes one and put it in his mouth and take his glove off. Then, he lights a cigarette. He hears a noise and realises that there is a baby crying over the floor. He takes him and starts to look for someone. At the same time, a lady appears behind him carrying a baby cart, the lady goes upstairs and he leaves the baby in the cart. The lady appears again, she looks very upset and tells him that she is not the responsible of the baby, he is not hers. He tries to get rid of  the baby, leaving him in the same place where he found him but in that moment, a sheriff comes up and he has to lift the baby again. He starts to walk looking for a place to leave the baby without being seen. He finds an old man, gives the baby to him and runs, hiding him from the man. This one finds the baby cart's woman on his way and leaves the baby on it. The lady finds the baby in her cart again. Chaplin is passing by there at that point and she runs behind him and starts to beat him with an umbrella. The policeman is walking around there again and she blames Chaplin for the baby. He takes the baby and looks, desperately, for a place to leave him. He finds a drain on the floor and thinks about putting him inside, but finally, he feels sorry for the baby and does not do it. At the end of the video, Chaplin finds a note in the baby's clothes that says: take care and love this orphan child. He smiles and goes back home carrying the baby. The video is about how Chaplin finds a baby on the street. As a result of that meeting, he tries to leave the baby to anyone who is on the streets because he doesn't want to be responsible for him. For example, he tries to give him to a woman that has a cart in which there's already a baby or to a vagabond who is having a walk quietly. It is also interesting the fact that he meets a policeman everytime he gives the child to someone and the policeman thinks the baby is from Chaplin and that he wants to leave him. Despite all the attempts, the baby in one way or another returns to Chaplin's arms and he finds a note that was in the baby's clothes. The note explains that the people that has left the child wants him to be treated with love. This note convinces Chaplin and he decides to take care of him. At the beginning of the story we see how rubbish is thrown from the windows, as Chaplin is walking on the street. Suddenly he discovers an abandoned baby in the floor next to the garbage and he takes it. At the same time a woman carrying a baby trolley appears in the scene, and so, Chaplin thinks that the baby should be hers.\n",

      "When he insinuates her that she should have lost it she get angry and in a bad way tells him to get away. After this, Chaplin goes to leave the baby in the same place where he has found it but the appearence of a policeman dissudades him and takes it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the baby in his arms, Chaplin doesn't know what to do with it, till he finds the way to stuck it to a poor man and run away. This poor man, also, doesn't know what to do with it and, suddenly, he founds out a baby trolley in the street so he places it inside and run. However, the owner of the trolley appears, who is the woman appearing before, and by coincidence, Chaplin is wandering around. Thus, the woman thinks that the same man has tried to cheat her twice. She starts shouting and so, Chaplin has to take the baby with him again.\n",
      "\n",

This video starts with Chaplin walking on the street. Suddenly, something falls down from the buildings and strikes him. Then, he stops, he looks at the sky, turns on his cigarettes  in a strange way and he carries on his walking. However, he finds a baby behind the litter. He look at the street in order to know why a baby was there and he sees a woman with a trolley. He puts the baby on the trolley but the woman tells  him off due to the fact that the baby is not her child. Later, he comes back to the place where the baby was and leaves the child there, but a policeman sees him and he pick the kid up and starts to walk down the street. Seconds later, he sees a old man and asks him for holding the baby while he is attaching his shoes but he runs away. Whereas he is trying to hide from the old man, the ancient puts the baby in the same trolley as Chaplin. Once that Chaplin thinks that the baby has disappeared, he retakes his path. However, the women with the trolley sees him and runs after him and she gives back the baby. Finally, he sits down on the street with the baby between his arms and finds that the baby has a letter with him saying that he/she needs someone who takes care and love for him. The last scenes is Chaplin hugging the little baby with a huge smile. In scene, Chaplin appears walking in a passage. A man, through the window, throws rubbles to the street and almost they fall down on him. Caplin, without distresses, cleans the powder of his clothes and continues walking while he smokes. In the walking, somebody goes back to throw rubblesto the street, but now, unfortunately, they fall down on him. He throws out his gloves and lights a cigarette. Suddenly, he finds a baby who is crying in the corner of the street and looks at all sides if there is somebody. Simultaneously, a mother walks behind him with her baby in the covered wagon and Chaplin approaches her. She gets distracted and makes alone the wagon. This situation helps Chaplin to drop the baby inside it. However, the mother notices it and asks him to take \"his\" baby. After that, he, humorously, takes her baby and the mother says no, this baby is hers. Chaplin takes \"his\" baby and the woman goes away. Before that, he decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him, but a policeman appears and he takes again the baby. In his escape, he sees a man and, discreetly, asks him to take the baby for a moment. In this moment, he decides to run but the man realizes it. Chaplin achieves to  hide in a hallway and the man finds the mother who was found by Chaplin later. The man decides to drop the baby in the wagon because the mother was not there. On the other hand, Chaplin ,after going out of his hiding place, sees the policeman again, but this time without the baby. He pretends and manages to avoid him. The woman realizes the new baby in her wagon and, in the same moment, Chaplin appears walking. She follows him and hits him with her umbrella. Again, she asks him to take the baby and he plays dumb. The policeman appears and the woman tells him what has happened, and Chaplin ends up by taking again the baby. Chaplin, without knowing what to do, sits down in a kerb and sees a sewer. After thinking to leave the baby there, he does not leave him there and decide to see if there is something inside the blanket that covers him. He sees a note that says that this child is orphaned and that pleasetake care of him. After reading this, Chaplin looks shocked at the baby and decides to be in charge of him. there was a man walking on the street while he was smoking a ciggie. Suddenly, he sees a baby and decided to get him. Then he sees a woman and tries to put the baby on the pram but the woman says the baby is not hers. After the police coming he goes and tries to trick and old man.  He tells the old mand to hold the baby.So after many attempts, he decided to keep the child because he learns is an orphanage. First and foremost we are speaking about a mute short film whose main character is a man with apparently no luck in life as we can see in various occasions. Firstly he passed through a drop of work material as it could be cement. Secondly he founded a baby that at first he thought someone must have lost him so he keep on trying to give it to someone else in order to feel free again with any responsability or blame but then he realised that the baby was and an orphan and something on his inside changed. Finally he decided to keep it. To conclude we can highlight the fact that how quick can change our lifes without even noticing about it. Chaplin was walking on the street where people throw objects out the window, then he takes out a box with cigarette butts, he takes one in his mouth and throw away his gloves, when suddenly he sees a baby in the street while a woman was walking with a baby carriage, so he thinks that that baby was hers but it wasn't.\n",
      "He tries to get rid of the baby, but he can't.\n",
      "After he sees a note in the baby's clothes, he decides to take care of it. First, Charles Chaplin is on a street in a poor old town. He is smoking and suddenly objects fall from above. He is amazed and takes out a case where he carries cigarettes and lights one. Next, he throws his gloves in a bin. When he leaves, he finds an abandoned baby crying next to buckets. Chaplin, tries to look for the parents, but he doesn’t see anyone, so he takes it. In those moments, an old woman passes with a baby car and another baby, then he thinks it’s hers, addresses the woman and put the baby in the baby car. Then they argue and Charles takes the baby and they leave. Next, he leaves it back where he found it, but a police see him and brings it again. \n",
      "Second, when he was walking down the street, he sees a man. He gives him the baby and ties his shoelaces. When he finished, he runs out and hides, then the man leaves the baby in the lady’s baby car that Charles had found at first. When Chaplin leaves his hideout, he passes carelessly down the street where the lady was with the baby car and the two babies, they argue again, the policeman arrives and immediately he takes the baby back and sits on a sidewalk. Right next to it is a sewer, he grabs it and thinks about throwing the baby over there but realizes that the child has a note between his blankets, he reads it.\n",
      "Finally he thinks that the best thing is to stay with the baby and take care of it. This video is about a man (Charles Chaplin) who is walking down the street and suddenly he finds a little baby crying in the ground that has been abandoned. The man takes the baby and he tries to give it to a woman when she is not aware of it. He lets the baby inside the woman's baby carriage, but the woman notices it so she gives the baby back to the man because she doesn't want it. He sees a policeman that is taking a walk so he conceals. Then, he sees a man and he asks for him to hold the baby while he ties up his shoes and suddenly he (Chaplin) runs out so the man stays with the baby. The man makes the same tactic about the woman's baby carriage that Chaplin did before and he gets to scape from keeping the baby. Chaplin passes next to that woman who has seen already the baby and she starts to follow him to give him back the baby, and finally she reaches him. Chaplin doesn't know what to do anymore so he sits down on the ground with the baby on his arms and suddenly he sees a note that the baby has inside his clothes and it says that the person who found that orphan baby took care of him and loved him, so Chaplin heeds it and stays with the baby at the end. At the beginning of the scene, Chaplin appears walking through a street, and he does not seem very worried. He goes under a window where a man is throwing something that provoques some dust, this is ignored by the protagonist. He keeps on walking and while he grabs his flexible walking stick, a lot of rubbish coming from above him, falls over Charlie making him dirty and also scaring him. Then he decides to take his gloves off and throwing them to the rubbish and to smoke a cigarette he took from a metallic box that he had in his pocket. It is then when he finds out there is a baby left on the street's floor crying, so he decides to get the baby and see if he can solve this problem. Chaplin starts looking around and then suddenly sees a woman with a baby car who seems to be looking for something, this makes him thiink it is the baby's mother. When he gets close and gives the baby to the woman, he finds out that he is confused and that the baby does not belong to that woman. After trying to leave the baby back to where he found it, a police walks in the place and make him get the child again. This leeds our protagonist to do what he does next, to fool a man he sees in the street and to give him the baby. This new man does not know what to do and as he sees a baby car with an empty place, he decides to leave the baby there. Yes, it was the first woman's baby car and unfortunately, she comes of the establishment she is in, coinciding with Charlie again, so she thinks this time it was him too who is trying to deceive her. Finally, Chaplin finds himself one more time with the child and after considering the option of leaving him, he observes a paper into the baby's clothes that says to love and to take care of that orphan boy. After being thrown away and hit in the head with a vase, Chaplin looks for a cigarete in order to smoke, while he is litting the cigarete he sees a baby crying on the floor. A woman appears behind him and Chaplin thinks that the baby is hers, but the baby it's not so the woman argues with him telling the baby does not belong to her. Chaplin takes the baby away and pretends to abandon it but a policeman sees him and oblies Chaplin to pick it up and take the baby with him.Chaplin takes the baby and while asking a man for carrying the baby for a second he rans away. The man leaves the baby again in the woman's trolley and leaves, this is the moment when Chaplin appears and the lady sees that he has left the baby again in the trolley, the policeman appears another time and Chaplin runs away with the baby. While sitting on the floor he sees that the baby is carrying a note, the baby is an orphan and has no family. Chaplin feels bad and takes the baby to live with him. Charles Chaplin were walking down the street when he saw a baby crying.He took the baby and put in the pram of a woman who was there, but she told to Charles that the baby didn't belong to her, so Charles took the baby again and he tried to drop out him, but a police man saw this and told Chaplin that was forbidden.\n",
      "He took the baby once more and saw a men. Charles asked the man to hold the baby a moment while he was buttoning the shoelaces, but he finally ran away.\n",
      "This man left the baby in the pram of the woman again but Chaplin had to took the baby for the last time.\n",
      "Finally, he sat down on the sidewalk and noticed about that the baby had a note which asked someone to take care and love the orphan babay, so Charles and the baby went together. Chaplin was walking in a narrow street, somebody was throwing things on the second floor back to Chaplin. Then something dropped over Chaplin, and he realized that a baby was there, he saw at the distance a woman with a car for babies, and he carry the baby to the woman and put the baby in the car for babies, but the woman said that baby wasn't hers. Then he went back to the place where he took the baby and a policeman saw him doing that. The policeman didn't let him putting the baby there. So he picked up the baby and gave the baby to an old man, then he ran to the same direction where the policeman was. The old man saw the car for babies, so he put the baby there because no one was watching him. When Chaplin saw the policeman again, he went back to the same direction of the old man. Then the woman saw the baby on the car and she saw Chaplin and went to hit him with the umbrella, so Chaplin picked again the baby and went to have a seat on the pavement. Then he saw a letter (I didn't see clear the video). He smiled and he stood up and began to walk. The end. In this video, Charlie Chaplin is walking around the street in a marginal neighbourhood. Some people are throwing rabbish through a window and he decides to stop walking and smoke a cigarette. Then, he discovers a baby who is crying and he tries to find his family. He sees a woman who is having a walk with her baby and he thinks that the baby maybe owns to her, so he puts the baby next to the other child who is in a baby cart. The woman realises of that and she has a dispute with him because he was not allowed to do that. After that event, Charlie Chaplin tries to abandon the baby in the same place whre he found him but a policeman sees him and he obligues him to look after the child. Then, Chaplin sees an old man and he gives him the baby. The poor man does not react after a few seconds and he feels nervous so he decides to follow him. After that, the old man put the child in a baby cart which is next to a shop and he goes. When the owner of the baby cart (a lady) leaves from the shop, she realises that there is another child next to her baby. Finally, Charlie Chaplin is having a walk in the same street and the woman sees him. She hurts him with an umbrella and he is forced to care about the baby. To sum up, Chaplin discovers a note inside the blanket of the baby and he feels sad for him so he decides to live the rest of his life with him. At the beginning Chaplin is walking through the street and something falls from the sky. Then he is preparing a cigarette when he sees a baby crying on the floor. He takes the baby and tries to leave him next to another baby who is with his mother. However, the women realices what is happeing and she tells Chaplin he has to take the baby. Then Chaplin decides to leave the baby where he found him but a police officer appears and he has to take the baby again. He starts to walk through the street and finds a man, so he asks the man to take the baby while he is fixing his shoe but when the man take the baby he runs away. The man run after Chaplin who has hiden somewhere in the street, but he can't find Chaplin and he decides to leave the baby next to the baby Chaplin left before, and he run away as well. Then Chaplin appears in the same street a the mother of the other baby thinks he is the one who left the baby next to her baby so she starts to hit Chaplin in order to him to take the baby again. The police officer appears so Chaplin takes the baby and sit in the ground. Then he finds a note that was in the cloths of the baby in which there is a message: \"please love and care this orphan child\". The vídeo is about the character Chaplin who finds a little baby in the street. Firstly, he tries to leave the baby with a woman who was passing through the same street, but she realized he was not her baby, she gave back the baby to Chaplin, and he left the baby in the same place he found him, but suddenly, he turned around and found a policeman, and he had to keep the baby with him. He was sitting on the sidewalk and he found a note in the baby clothes. On a old street within a factory, probably from working-class, Chaplin tries to walk avoiding the falling bricks, but one falls on his head and he blames it. While he is walking he found a baby on the ground. He don't know what he can do with the baby so he tries to left together another baby of a woman who is walking at the same street. She refuse the second, strange baby and blames to Chaplin. Chaplin walks around the dirty streets and he is undecided about to do with the baby. He thinks on leave the baby another time on the ground, but immediately, a policeman see him and Chaplin tries to dissimulate. Another man who is walking like him appear in the scene. Chaplin tries to left the baby but this man and another time with the women, just leaving the baby there. The women hits him and the policeman see the scene. At the end of the short, Chaplin thinks about leave the baby under a sewer, but he is not able to do it and discover a note in the clothes of the baby. It says something similar to this: \"Take care of the baby\" and Chaplin finally decides to adopt the baby. In this scene from \"The Kid\", I've seen Chaplin walking on the street between some building in construction, when something from the sky got dropped on his head. He kept on walking smoking a cigarrette by the way he found a 2-month baby lying on the floor. He took the baby and looked for someone to take care of, so he saw a woman with another baby and tried to deliver him to her, although that woman wasn't his mom so she didn't accept the kid.\n",
      "In fact, the woman hit him on the back because she thought he was kidnapping her baby.\n",
      "He took off the baby and went to the corner where he found the baby and came to left him there, but a policeman watched him and he had to runaway with the baby. Some meters after that, another man walking on the street and Chaplin didn't lose the chance, he tried to give this man the problem..and the real problem came now, whe this new man tried to deliver the baby to the same woman as Chaplin tried before. Then, Chaplin kept on his walk and he watched that woman again..she run to him from his back and hit him again on the head, she left him with the baby and leave the scene. The last minute was emotive because Chaplin noticed that the baby had a handwrite note which told he was an orphan, so Chaplin adopted him as his child. In this video we can see Charles Chaplin walking at the street. Suddenly he finds an abandoned baby on the ground. Since that moment Chaplin tries to find her mother. He sees a woman with her baby and then set the abandoned baby into her babycar. The woman realises what Chaplin does and gives  him the baby back. After that, Chaplin leaves the baby on the ground but in that moment a police see what Chaplin was doing, that’s why he takes the baby again. Chaplin finds a poorman and gives him the baby. This man sets him into the babycar, like Chaplin had done before. The woman realises she has two babies and looks for Chaplin to gives him the baby back. Finally, Chaplin decides to write a note next to the baby where is written something like this: “Please, I look for a person who cares me” A man was walking away, and someone threw away garbage from a window.  Suddenly he found a baby on the floor near to a trash can.  Then, he dindn't know what to do with him.  His first idea was to leave the baby at the same place where he found it, but he saw that a police agent was looking at him.  So in this moment, a women dropped by this place with a troller, and he though that the baby  was hers, but he's not. Then he saw an old man and he wanted to leave the baby with him, but this man saw the same troller and put him in there and when the women found the baby again, she gave back to who she though that was his father.  He tried to do everything to get rid of the baby, but always found a reason to keep him on his arms.  There was a moment that he sat on the sidewalk and he found a paper that says \"please, love and take care this orphan baby\";  At this moment the man felt a special feeling for the baby, and decided to keep him. In this video Charles Chaplin finds a baby in a corner and he thinks that  he is property of a woman walking around and gives him to her, but he is not a child of  the woman and Charles leaves and leaves him in the same corner but he finds the police while he is doing it and has to leave with the child\n",
      "After he gives him to a person walking by and runs, and the person thinking again that is property of de woman, gives the baby to her. She sees Charles again and gives him to him.\n",
      "Eventually Charles reads in a note that the baby is orphan and decides to stay with him In the video that I have been able to see, we see a piece of a movie starring Chaplin. The protagonist is walking down the street while smoking. In the scene we can see a woman throwing objects out the window. Walking through a place where there is garbage, he picks up another cigarette and while smoking it, he finds a baby on the ground abandoned. He decides to pick it up and at that moment he finds a woman with a stroller for two babies. Seeing that this woman only had one baby in the cart, he places it in the other part of it, thinking that it would belong to the woman. The woman returns the baby to him because it was not hers. Not finding his parents, he places him where he was but at that moment, a policeman appears so he must pick up the baby again so as not to be scolded by the agent. Walking down the street, he gives the baby to a man who passes by. The man, not wanting the baby, casually places the baby in the stroller of the woman who appeared earlier. When the woman realized that the baby was back in the stroller, she blames Chaplin. In addition, the policeman appears, so Chaplin keeps the baby. At the end we see how the baby carried a note that said take care of him. Chaplin decides to stay with him permanently. well the video is about the famous charlie chaplin finding an abandoned child on the street, he tries to get rid of him in a thousand different ways such as giving him to an older man, or thinking of leaving him in a sewer, but the child always return to him for many difirrents reason like a policeman that see charly trying to left the baby in the street again, finally chaplin gives way because he reads a note that came with the baby and stays with him While Chaplin was taking a walk through a place that seemed to be under construction, he found a baby lying on the floor. He didn't know where the baby came from so when a woman passed whit a baby carriage Chaplin tried to give the baby to her but she refused and started arguing with he. After the woman lelf Chaplin decided to leave the baby where he found him but this didn't work because a police man appeared and he had to take the baby again. Later Chaplin saw a men and he gave him the baby and ran away, he thought he had made it but the man who he had given the baby gave it to the woman with the baby carriage, she saw Chaplin there and starte hiting him because she thought he left the baby there. Chaplin had to take over again the baby but then he found that in the baby's clothes there was a paper which said “give love to this orphan baby”, this apparently melted Chaplin's heart and he decided to keep the baby. Chaplin was walking calmly around the streets doing his business. Suddenly, he found a little baby crying in the middle of the street and Chaplin did not know exactly what to do. He came up with the idea of giving it to the woman he saw a little after, since she was carrying her baby in a baby buggy, but the woman rejected inmediatedly due to the fact that that child was not her baby. Then, he was going to place the baby in the same spot he was found but a policy agent was watching him, so he could not. After that, he came up with the idea of giving it to a strange with the following excuse \"can you hold my baby for a second please?\". Surprisingly, he could get rid of the baby, but it was just for a minute, since the strange placed the baby in the same baby buggy that Chaplin did, so the woman hit Chaplin several times as soon as she saw him again. Finally, Chaplin had to get the baby out of there and when he was far enough he planned to throw it to the sewage. However, he founded a letter between the cloths of the baby, in which was written the following sentence: \"Please take care of the child\" and after reading that, Chaplin couldn't do anything else than taking care of the baby by his own. At first we see Chaplin walking while people throw rubbish from their houses, then he starts smoking until he find a baby in the street. He tries to give the baby to a woman but she doesn't want it, after that tries to put him back where he found him but there was a police man looking at him, then he finds a man and tricks him to make him take the baby and hides from the man. After that the man left the baby with the woman again and when the woman notices that the baby is there she gets mad at Chaplin who is walking in the street. Then Chaplin found a note in baby's clothes which ask him to take care of the baby. In this video, you can see a man walking down a street normally, dressed in old clothes: a hat, a suit with a long jacket, baggy pants, and even a cane, which details us more or me. \n",
      "The moment he turns around, he observes that there is an abandoned baby next to a container. He takes it, and tries to give it to any woman or man who passes by. \n",
      "Nobody wants it, so he decides to keep it and discovers that the baby carries a significant note. Chaplin realized there is a kid next to him in the moment he is having a cigarette, there is when he starts to find a solution about his child. \n",
      "First of all he saw a woman and thought the baby belongs to her because this woman had another baby, he tried to give him back to her but she said he was not her child in a annoying way. \n",
      "Chaplin is still getting rid of him and put him back in the floor where he found him but the police caught him, so Chaplin pretended he was not doing that and picked up the baby again.\n",
      "Chaplin is still thinking in a solution and try to give the baby to an old man by lying. Chaplin, apparently succeded with this act and continues his way. But he did not realized that this man put the baby back to the basket of the woman with the other kid, and when she realizes, she just saw Chaplin around there and beated him up. Chaplin get the child back again and, apparently, tired, he just try to take care of the baby and see a note where it puts: '' please, love and take care of this orphan baby''. Charles Chaplin is walking around, and some many people start throwing some rubbish out through the balconies. Then, Chaplin finds out that there is a baby next to a rubbish trash, and he starts to look for the mother of this baby. He finds a woman looking for something and he decides to put the baby inside of her baby buggy, but this woman get mad at him because he's not her baby, so he take him back and put him again next to the rubbish. A police man sees the action and Chaplin take him again. Suddenly, Chaplin finds a man walking around and he gives him to the other man and start running away in order to hide from this man. This man finds the same baby buggy and put him inside. Finally, the woman sees Chaplin again and run to him in order to give him back the baby. At the end, Chaplin finds out that there is a note inside the clothes of this kid, and sees that it says \"please love and care for this orphan child\", so he decides to take care of him. In this video, I can see Chaplin walking along a very poor neigbourhood because of the old appearance of one of the buildings , which were falling some bricks. He went on walking along the neigbourhood while was smoking a cigarrete , watching all what was happening around him when he suddenly found a little  newborn baby covered by a blanket next to a rubbish bin . So , he held the baby in his arms wondering who could be the mother of this very little child when he saw a woman taking a baby carriage with a little child inside and he thought that woman was mother's newborn baby that he was taking in his arms and he put the baby in the baby carriage. But surprisingly, that woman was not mother's baby and he put the baby next to the rubbish again but when he was going to continue on his way, he came across with a policeman , who was looking him angrily because of the fact that he had just commited. Then, Chaplin tried to run away of the policeman and he put the baby in the arms of a man who was walking along the same street but the man returned him baby . Chaplin was so desperated that he didn't know what to do with the baby until he saw another woman with a baby carriage and he put the baby inside again but that woman was not the mother , so he thought to leave the baby inside of a canal of water. But when he was about to leave the baby inside, he came across a sheet of paper where was written that the baby was orphan and needed someone to take care of him , he saw the baby with a piece of ternderness ,he huggeg the baby and he leave with him happily. Charles Chaplin is walking around the street. Suddenly, someone throws trash out of a window and hits Charles. He stops by and starts smoking. Then, he hears a child crying, and he finds a child laying on the floor. Quickly, he picks up the child from the ground and starts looking for someone who can take care of him. He tries to give the child to a woman who is walking around with another baby and a cart, but she refuses to take care of the unknown baby. Once he have tried it, he come back to the place where he found that baby and leaves him on the floor again. But in that moment, a police appears, so he picks up the child again. Later, Charles starts walking around and finds another man. Charles, pretends to be tying his laces and gives the child to that man, then, he starts running away again. This man goes to find Charles but instead of that, he gives the child to same lady as the beginning. The lady come out of a shop a sees the same baby in her cart. Suddenly, Charles starts walking around so the woman sees him. She starts to chase and hit Charles and she gives back the baby to him. Finally, Charles sits down on the street while he has the baby in his arms. He takes the decision to take care of the baby. In the video of Charles Chaplin we can see an orphan kid that is found by Chaplin himself. He finds her on the street and he tries to find her family. Once he takes the baby, he puts her in a carriage where there is another baby. The mother of this baby sees the action and Chaplin is forced to take the orphan girl out of there. Then, he gives her to a man and runs away. The man doesn't know what to do with the baby and he sees the same carriage that Chaplin have seen before. The man put the baby again in the carriage whilst the mother is in the shop and he flees quickly. When the mother goes out of the shop, she finds again the orphan baby in her carriage and, in this same moment, she sees Chaplin walking down the street. Chaplin is once again forced to keep the baby and finally he decides to take care of her. In the video we see  a man who is walking on the Street, while he is walking some people are throwing things through the Windows of their houses, it annoyed Charles Chapling so he decides to fire a cigarrette, in that momento he realices there is a baby near the trash can, he pick up the baby and in that moment he sees a woman with another baby on a big buggy, and she seems to be nervous as if she were looking for something, so Chaplin thinks that she is looking for the baby, and he put the baby in the buggy among with the other child. The woman got angry because the baby doesn't belong to her, in that moment Chaplin pick up the baby again and he tries to let him where he found him, but he realices there is a policeman watching him, and if he let the baby there the policeman will think he is abandoning the baby so Chaplin woulf be arrested, Chaplin continues walking with the baby and he ask a man to hold him while he pretend that he is tiding his shoes, then Chapling run away and let the baby with the old man. This man, who is walking with the baby. sees again the buggy, the lady is not there, and he lets the baby on the buggy and ran away, in a few secods the lady appear again and sees the baby, she gets really angry and in that same moment, by chance, chapling is waliking near them, when the lady sees him she starts to hit him, because she thinks that is him who has let again the baby there, so Chaplin hold again the baby and he sits on the edge of a sidewalk, in that moment he realizes there is a note between the baby's clothes thats says, love and take care of this orphan baby, Chaplin Kiss and hugs the baby, stands up and starts to walk again, this is an opend ended story because we don't know what will happen next. One day, Chaplin was walking along the street when suddenly he realized that there was a baby deposited on the ground. Instictively, he decides to take the infant on his arms and soothe it. Charles' first aim starts to be finding a place to leave the child, so he sees a woman walking down the street with a prump and quickly he introduces the baby on that prump, the woman discovers him, moreover, warns him to pick up the child immediately due to the fact that she is not the mother. Thereupon, he returns the child where he found it, but a policeman does not allow him to do that. His following move, is trying to hoodwink a man in order to free himself from the baby, unfortunately his plan fails and the baby returns to him. Finally, he sits down on the street with the creature, discovers a note and decides to love it. The film starts with Charles Chaplin walking through some old buildings. A woman who is in the window throws to Chaplin some stuff. Then he continues walking and stops near a bin to light up a cigarette, the way he lights up the cigarette is very funny. He looks at his left and find a baby who is wrapped in different pieces of cloth, he is really surprised by his finding. \n",
      "He tries to leave the baby in some different ways but he can’t.

He finds a baby on the street, but he saw a woman with a child cart and he thought it was woman's baby, so he decided to give him to the woman. But the woman's baby was already on the cart and she got really angry with Charles. He tried to leave the baby in the street again, but a kind of policeman arrived and he had to pick him again. He gave the baby to an old man, and he started to run. This old man left the baby with the woman earlier mentioned, but she saw Charles and she gave the baby to him again. At the end of that video, Charles saw that the baby had a note asking for help and for taking care of the baby, so he decided to take care of this abandoned baby.

So when she noticed that she thought Chaplin has done it. Finally, Chaplin saw that the baby had a paper that asked him to take care of the child and he adopt the baby. This video is another proof of the talent and unique personality that Mr. Charles Chaplin had. He is cunningly treating a really serious and tragic topic through a humoristic sketch. At Chaplin's time, many orphans were abandoned on the streets or in front of orphanage because their, normally, single mothers were unable to give them the life they deserve. In other cases, they abandoned them because they were not supposed to have children or those children were the result of a rape and that fact had to be hidden no matter what it cost. Some of the kids died and many others stayed their whole life in a place where they were not happy nor well-treated. Fortunately, several children had the chance of a brand new life when people like our protagonist decided to take care of those little and vulnerable souls. Charles Chaplin was walking alone in the street smoking when he was thrown from a window a sort of flowerpot stand. After that, he realized there was an abandoned kid lying on the floor and he took it and just some seconds after he took the kid a lady pushing a baby carriage passed around. Because of that, he thought that this kid was her son/daughter so he placed him/her on the carriage. However, the baby wasn't hers, and as a result Chaplin was scolded by the lady and he decided to return the baby on the corner where he found him/her, but it was impossible since a policeman discovered him doing that. Some seconds later, an old man waslking in the street and Chaplin did his best to give the baby to the man, he was able to do that, but unfortunately the baby ended up on the lady's carriage and when the lady realized about that Chaplin was walking next to the carriage and she thought it was him again, so she hit him with an umbrella on the head. Finally, after some seconds holding the baby, he discovered a piece of paper he/she had under the dress saying that it was an orphan baby that hoped to find someione who loved him/her. Charles Chaplin is walking through a street and, suddenly, he sees a baby abandoned behind a bin. He decides to grab the baby and, when he is thinking of a solution, he watches a woman that seems to be looking for something or someone. He assumes that she is looking for the baby as she is probably the mother. She has another baby in a pram so, Chaplin decides to put the baby in the pram as well. The mother seems to be upset because she is not apparently the mother of the child. Chaplin puts the baby again behind the bin, but a police man discovers him dropping the baby and Chaplin rapidly grabs it again and runs away with it. Later on, he encounters with a man and he tricks him to take the baby. After the man is holding the baby, Chaplin runs away. The man sees the pram which Chaplin saw before and places the baby in it. When the mother discovers the baby in the pram again, she looks for Chaplin and she forces him to take the baby. When Chaplin is holding the baby, he finds out a note underneath its clothes. The note says to take care of the orphaned child. This note makes Chaplin think and he finally decides to take here of him. Chaplin is walking and he sees a little baby abandoned in the street, he doesn’t know what to do with him so he sees a woman with a pram and puts the baby in it.

Chaplin goes back to where he found the baby and put him in the same place but a policeman arrives and thinks that he is abandoning the baby so he has to take it back. He sees a man walking in the street and he gives him the baby and run away. The man sees the same woman with the pram and put the baby in it. When she comes out of a store she gets angry because there ir again a baby in her pram that is not hers so when Chaplin pass by her she gives the baby back to her really angry. Chaplin does not know what to do with the baby so he sits in the street and he finda a piece of paper with the baby saying that please take care of him and give the baby love, so Chaplin stay with the baby. Chaplin appears walking on the street apparently doing nothingt. He finds a lost baby and cares about it wondering what happened to him. After many attempts to find someone who takes the baby and thinking what to do, he decides to keep it himself. He discovers a note in the baby’s jacket that makes his mind change. It’s interesting the fact that everything is clearly understood despite no one speaks a single word. During a walk through an industrial area and while enjoying a cuban cigar, Chaplin suddenly gets hit by some bricks. By lighting a cigarette, he then discovers an abandoned baby on the ground, worried and after seeing a mum going for a walk with her baby, he thinks she had dropped the baby. Quickly and convinced that the baby belongs to her, he takes the baby to the lady. Nevertheless, the lady gets mad, rejecting the fact of being her baby. With him among is hands again, Chaplin tries to put him back where he had found him but, just before doing so, a police officer crosses by, scaring him from abandoning the child. Afterwards, he walks away from the officer and, by tricking an old man, he gets rid of the baby. Unluckily, the old man crosses the lady and leaves the baby in the lady's wheel without she realizing what was happening. Happy and relaxed, Chaplin walks by the lady again in the exact moment she realizes the baby was again in her chariot, thinking it was Chaplin again trying to get rid of him. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby and soon discovers there was a note with him, saying he was an orphan child and asking for help. Happy again, Chaplin stands up and keeps walking happy with his new child. There is a man walking in the street. He seems to be a little bit clumsy. He suffers some tumbles. Then he dedices to smoke a cigarrete and meanwhile he realises that there is a baby knock down in the floor. He tries to find his mother but it is imposible. So, he tries to get rid of the baby but the police is always guarding him. Finally, he find a piece of paper between the baby's clothes. The baby is an orphan looking for a family. At the end of the video, the man seems to grow fond of the baby. This shortfilm with Charles Chaplin acting on it starts with the actor walking on the street while someone's throwing garbage from the balconies. He looks up and seems to think that those people throwing things are acting weird. Then he stops next to a bin, he opens a box with cigars, takes one and saves the box again on his pocket, and gets to light the cigar with his shoe. Suddenly, he finds out there's a baby hidden next to the bin covered with some baby blankets, it seems he's been abandoned. The man grabs him from the street, and as he has seen a woman having a walk with a pushchair and another baby, he recabes her and tell her that she has left the baby behind, but the woman yells at him and tell him to take him again because it's not her baby. After that, he tries to put the baby again where he found him, but then a policeman appears on scene and takes the baby again with him. Thinking how to get the baby away from him, he goes on a walk and when he finds a man, he asks him to Carry the baby for a moment while he puts correctly the laces of his shoe.

It is a video in which two characters appear, Charles Chaplin and a small kid. The first one seems to be well dressed, although it is contradictory at the moment in which a cigarette case appears and he appropriates it. He is in an alley where he is struck by debris. After this, a baby is found lying on the street with no one around. At this point, the protagonist does not know very well what to do and desperately he tries to get rid of him but he can’t achieve it. Suddenly he stumbles over the police and picks up the baby again. However, he continues in the attempt to get rid of the baby by leaving him to another man who appears in the street. The man returns the baby to a baby car and the owner of it returns him to Charles Chaplin again. It seems as if it was fate, trying to give the protagonist somebody to stay with, to stop that feeling of loneliness that he may have. He is still thinking of somewhere to leave the baby but he seems to be worried in turn and he seems to be accepting the reality. Then, he finds a note inside the baby's clothes in which someone asks the one who finds the baby to love and care for him, because he is orphaned. Suddenly, the man seems to feel sorry and at the same time content. Finally, he begins to make the baby smile and leaves with him. The video presents a tone of tragedy where there is fear and pity but at the end there is a sense of happiness and hope for that baby. One young man finds a small child on the road. He tries to place him in a trolley, where another child was as well, although that child's mother saw him and asked the man what was he doing. Then, the man tries to give the child he had found to another man, who placed the child in the same trolley, in which the young man placed him before. The mother sees him, and when a police oficer arrives to the scene, the young man finally carries with the small child. He discovers a paper where \"take care of this child\" was writte, and that's what he did. Chaplin is hanging out when someone starts throwing things thought the window. He decides to smoke a cigarette and founds a baby. He tries to place the baby together with another baby while the mother of the second one is not looking but eventually she founds out and she furiously asks Chaplin to take the baby back. So turns back and he was at the brink of leaving the baby laying on the street alone again when he comes face to face with a police officer and has to take the baby back again. Chaplin’s plan is now to hand it to an old man that is passing by pretending he was trying to do something with is hands. But again, his plan was spoiled because the old man places the baby with the baby that appears at the beginning with his mum and the mum runs after Chaplin and hits him because the thinks it was Chaplin who placed the baby there again. At this point the police officer appears and has a talk with Chaplin. At the end Chaplin finds a note with the baby asking the person who finds the baby to love him. Chaplin and the baby leave together happily In this video, we can see how Charles Chaplin finds a baby on the street. He tried to get rid of him so that he put the baby in a baby carriage but he got nothing and he tried also to cheat a man confusing him and making him think that he's tying his shoe; until he finally discovered a note hidden with the baby's blanket and he realised that the baby is orphan and needs love and care so he decides to look after him. This is a scene of the film The Kid by Charles Chaplin. The scene is about Chaplin that, while he is smoking on the street, he finds a baby lying on the floor. He might have been abandoned. Chaplin decides that he has to find a place for the baby and therefore, he starts thinking what to do. Suddenly, he sees a woman that is carrying her own baby on a trolley. Chaplin thinks that the baby is hers or that maybe she could take care of him. However, when Chaplin puts the baby in the trolley, the woman shouts at him as the baby is not hers. Because of that, Chaplin decides to put the baby again on the place where he found him but, a police officer warns Chaplin that he cannot abandone a baby, as if he or she was his own child. Chaplin takes the baby again on his arms and starts walking on the street. He sees another man and Chaplin gives the baby to him. This aforementioned man sees the trolley of the prior woman again. When the woman realizes that the baby is again on the trolley, she gives the baby to Chaplin as if it was him the one who put the baby there. As Chaplin do not get to find a place for the baby, he decides to take a rest to think and he sits on the street with the baby on his arms. At that moment, he finds a note from the actual mother of the baby, saying that please take care of the child as he was yours. As a consequence, Chaplin decides to adopt the baby. Charles Chaplin is lighting a cigarrette when he finds a baby crying on the floor. While he is examining the baby, a woman with a pushing chair and another baby inside passes by and he thinks that she is the baby's mother. He tries to put the baby in the pussing chair next to the other baby saying \"Pardon me, you dropped something\" (which is funny). The lady hits him because that baby is not hers, and Chaplin has to take the baby out again. When he is trying to leave the baby in the place where he found him, a policeman sees him and he has to pretend he is taking care of the baby. Later, he gives the baby to a man that is walking down the street and runs away. This man casually leaves the baby in the pushing chair of the lady of the beginning. When Chaplin walks into the lady in the street, the lady again punchs him and the policeman appears, so Chaplin takes the baby and leaves with him. Finally, when he is lying in the street with the baby, he finds a note that begs love and care for that orphan child. The video ends with Chaplin leaving with the baby.

As he does not know where the baby has dropped from, he thinks that it may belong to a woman that has other baby, thus, he puts the baby into the baby cart of the woman. However, the woman denies that the baby is hers. He is uncertain about what to do with the baby, so, he decides to leave them on the ground where he found them. When he was close to leave the baby there, a policeman came and he had to pick up the baby. After all that did not work, he decides to give the baby to an old man while he tie his shoelaces. Immediately, he runs away and hides at the same time that the old man holds the baby. That old man finds the same woman with the baby cart and he introduces the baby there. Then, the woman sees the first man walking around and thinks that he has put the baby inside the baby cart again, therefore, he had to pick up the baby. Finally, he accepts his fate and sits on a kerb where he realizes that there is a note that says that this baby is an orphan. At the end, he seems to understand the situation of the baby and he decides to take care of them.

A man called Charles walks quietly down the street when he suddenly makes a discovery and he finds an abandoned baby wrapped in a blanket. Later, he finds a mother with a baby carriage walking with his son, so he thinks he could be their mother too and puts the child he had found in the carriage, but she argues with him and says she is not the baby's mother. Then, a policeman catches Charles leaving the baby where he found him earlier so he must pick him up again. Next, he meets a man and with the excuse of tying his shoes asks him to hold the baby and then run away without him.

Then Charles takes him again and tries to put him back where he found him but a policeman sees it and Charles takes the baby again and leaves. Charles finds an old man and gives the baby to him. The old man finds the lady with her pushchair alone and puts the baby there, then he leaves. Suddenly, Charles appears in that moment and the lady sees him and the baby in the pushchair again, and gets mad with Charles. Once again, Charles takes him and leaves with the baby. He sits on a curb with the baby in arms and then he sees that the baby has a note and reads it. In the note was written: “Please,  love and care for this orphan child”. He decides to keep it. Chaplin is walking down the street, where there are a lot of reformations, and meanwhile he is smoking a cigarette. Then he realises that there is an abandoned baby next to a wall. He thinks that the baby’s mother is a lady who has already had another baby and he tries to leave the baby to an old man until he discover a papper that begs for care and attention to the baby. Consequently, he decides to look after the baby. The action of this video begins in a factory. There, Charles Chaplin finds a lonely baby. He caughts him and gives to a woman who already has a child, but she says he is not her son. Then, Chaplin tries to leave the baby with someone to take care of him but nobody wants him. After several tries, he sit down on the street and discovers a note inside the baby's clothes. The note says: love and care for this orphan child. Finally, Chaplin decides to stay with the orphan baby. It is about Charles Chaplin, he is walking in the street when he notices that people is throwing some rubbish through the window. Although he tries to avoid that, he can not and some of the rubbish is thrown upon him and that makes him loses his cigarette. Then, he takes a can from his pocket that contains some more  cigarettes and gets another one. Suddenly, he finds an abandoned baby near the bins, he does not know what the baby is doing there. So, he decides to take the baby and look for their parents but Charles does not find anyone in the street,  the only person he sees is a woman who is carrying a little baby car and he decides to leave the baby in that car. When the woman notices that, she begins to tell him very angrily that it is not her baby, he takes the baby again and he is going to leave it in the same place where he found it but in a sudden the police is behind him, so he takes the baby as if nothing were happening. He goes left and he finds a man who is walking, he says to him that if he could maintain the baby whereas he makes something with his shoes and rapidly, he runs away and abandons the baby. The man with the baby chases after him but he does not find him. The only thing he finds is newly the woman with the baby car, so he puts the baby there again and leaves the place. When the woman realises that the baby is there, she thinks that Chaplin has put the baby again on his baby car. On the other hand, Chaplin is trying to avoid the police everytime, she sees him and he starts to run just in the direction which the angry woman is. The woman chases after him thinking that he was the one who put the baby in his car and she hits Chaplin with an umbrella. Chaplin does not know what to do with the baby, then he discovers that the baby has a note within the clothes that says something like \"Take after him\" and he finally adopts the baby. Chaplin is passing through a narrow street and he finds a baby. He thinks the baby belongs to the woman with another baby, but he is wrong and the woman gives the baby back to him. Chaplin put the baby down again, but a police told him he cannot do it. Chaplin takes the baby again and, while he pretends he is touching his shoes, he asked a man to hold the baby and Chaplin runs away. The man with the baby gives him back to the lady and the lady sees Chaplin and she gives him the baby. At the end Chaplin finds a note in the baby's clothes whose words say that he had to love him. The video starts with Charles Chaplin walking down the street. Suddenly something fell on his head (a box with cigarettes). A few steps further he finds a baby laying there. He then, stars looking for the person to whom he may belong. He walks on a woman and thinks she may be the owner so he hands the child to her, but she isn’t the mother, so he takes him away. His first thought is to put the baby right were he was, but the police appears on the scene so he can’t. Having seen the situation he continues walking and finds a one-legged man, hands the child to him and starts running. The man, who doesn’t know what that is, puts it casually in the same trolley as Charles did before. When the woman realizes that the baby is with her again, she stops Charles and returns him back. Due to the fact that he doesn’t know what to do anymore, he decides to take the baby with him. Later he finds a letter in the child’s blanket that says “Please love and caer for this orphan child” so he feels pity and take care of the baby. He was walking and suddenly threw him away garbage, later he cleaned up his clothes and then  looked a cigar in his pocket, in a few more meters  he found a baby crying  in the Street, he didn't know what to do with the baby, after he try to left the baby in a troller but the owner of the troller realized that she had two babys, get angry and gave the baby back to chaplin, then Chaplin was confused and started  to walk, later he saw and along old man and leave the baby , the old man was shocked with the baby he saw a troller, the old man walked fast and left the baby in the troller, then when the mother went out of a store she surprised because she had two babys all of a sudden she saw walking a Chaplin and hit him with a  umbrella and get the baby back to Chaplin, finally he sat  in the Street and found a piece of paper inside the baby that said “love and care these ophren child), he suprised  looked at the sky and take the decision to reaised the baby. The video tell us a messy story centered on an orphan baby. At the beginning of the video, we see Charles Chaplin taken a walk around a building under construction. He is lighting a cigarette when he notices a baby on the ground. He looks around trying to find the baby's mom. He finds out a woman carrying a two-seater baby carriage with only one baby in. So he decides to put the other baby back in the carriage. She gets angry and give back the baby to Charles Chaplin. Then, he decides to put the baby back where he found him but a policeman sees him and scolds him. Chaplin takes the baby again but he gets to trick an old man to keep him. The old man leaves the baby on the carriage of the woman that Chaplin meets before. When she realizes, she sees Chaplin walking down the street and gives the baby back again to him. Finally Chaplin sits down the street and find a letter into the baby's clothes that says something like: \"please, give love to this orphan baby\". Chaplin decides to take care of the baby and the music turns lovely. A man is walking in the street, he is moving away of the place where rocks from the houses are falling down on to the floor. While he is smoking in a fun way, he finds a baby laying on the floor, that baby seems to be feeling blue because he is crying a lot. The man takes the baby with him and sees a poweful woman carrying her baby with him. So he goes to her and places the found baby with the other baby. When the woman realise what is happening she starts shouting at him and he has to take the baby back with him. After that, he walks to where he found that baby and place the baby on the floor again. But a police officer seems him and he acts like he is not leaving the baby. When the man comes face to face to a homeless man, he asks him to take the baby for a moment and starts running away. He succeeds in hiding himself. The homeless man place the baby in front to the other baby again, and managed to desapeared. That is when the first man decided to go out of the place where he is and the woman which has the two baby gets mad when she sees him again and jumps and hits him for giving her the baby. The police officer arrived when all of this was haooening and the man has to go with that poor baby. He find a note that asked for love to the child. Finally he starts huging the baby. We stand on a smelly and dirty street where fishes are thrown and Chaplin walks down. He is looking around and suddenly he finds a baby near the dumpster. Firstly, Chaplin is amazed and he starts looking for the baby's parents, so when he sees a woman with a twins carriage, he thinks that the baby is from her and he put it on the baby carriage but it is not and the angry woman give back the baby to Chaplin. Secondly, Chaplin doesn't want to take care of the baby so he leave the it near the dumpster, the problem is that a police man is watching what he does and Chaplin have to take again the baby. Chaplin without knowing watt else to do, gives the baby to a man who is walking around the street and he starts running. Even though, the baby is returned to Chaplin, because the man who was with the baby left it with the woman we talked about before and she gave the baby to Chaplin with the police in front of them. Finally, Chaplin, even thinking of leaving the baby in a sewer, finds a note that the baby carried which says love and care the baby, so in the end Chaplin becomes fond of the baby. To start with, I would like to say that I've seen Charles walking out of a building in an awkard way. He smokes a cigarette and he throws his gloves to the bin. Furthermore, he finds a baby in the bin and tries to find his mother. Besides, he talks to a woman with another baby and asks to her if it is her baby too. She denies it so he brings the baby back to the bin but a police man sees him. Afterwards he sees an old man in the street, gives the baby to him and runs away. Apart from that, the old man leaves the baby in the women's baby stroller. Moreover, when she finds the baby there she suspects of Chaplin and starts sticking him with an umbrella. On the other hand, she tells everything to the policeman so Chaplin takes the baby with him and goes away. In the end, he finds a note with the baby which says: \"Please, love and care for this orphan child\". To sum up, he smiles and decides to take care of him. Charles Chaplin walked quietly when he suddenly finds an abandoned baby in the street. At first he thinks that it is of a woman who was there with another baby, but the woman denies it and returns the child to him. Then Chaplin try to leave the baby where he had found him, but a police officer arrives, so he picks up the baby and continues on his way. He finds a man and disguise to give the child. The man puts the baby in the cart of the same woman as before, and when the woman realizes that, she thinks it was Chaplin and makes him pick it up again. Finally, Chaplin finds a note between the baby's clothes that says he was orphaned and need love, so he is in charge of him. The poor society where Chaplin appears shows many aspect of our daily life. Lot of problems take part of our routine and instead of afront them we do not care them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firslty the contrast between the main character and the street where he is located; the main problem for Chaplin is releated with the number of cigarrettes that he has instead of look around and see the pouverty and rubish of the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly the baby, when he notice that there is a baby behind him he search his parents. Then he see a woman with another baby, he think that she could be his mother, so when he put both babies together the mother get angry and he understand that he is not her baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chaplin seems to be worried because he try to abandom him but the police call his attention and he do not know what to do with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finnally he sit down on the floor with the baby and he notice that the little boy has a paper which says \"please take care of me\", and Chaplin take the baby with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bad situations of many families cause problems like these one, they are not able to give a good quality of life for their children and the believe that the best solution could be abandom them because another family with more sources could take care of them. The story is about a man who is walking  and he finds a baby in the rubbish. He thinks that the baby is there because of the baby's mother has lost it, so when he looks up a woman looking for something he thinks that she is the mother's baby. When he gives the woman the baby she says him that this baby is not her baby. Then, the policeman sees him with the baby in the rubbish and he thinks that the man has abandonated her but he explains the policeman the situation and he believe him. However, the man keeps trying to find the mother's baby but he doesn't do it. Finally, he sits in the street with the baby and he finds a note in her dress that says that she needs love and someone who takes care of her. In this video, we can see Charles Chaplin walking around smoking a cigarette in the middle of the street when suddenly, something falls down in him. He gets a little annoyed and get another cigarette. Right after that, he finds an abandoned  baby on the floor next to him. He decides to get him/her and tries to give it to different people. Firstly, he tries to give the baby to a lady who already has one on her own, he says \"Pardon me, you dropped something.\" The lady gets angry and give the baby back to him. He comes back to the place he found it and leaves it on the floor. However, a policeman sees him and he has the obligation to take it again. Now, he leaves the baby to a man he finds walking in the street and starts running. This man leaves it in the lady's pram we saw at first, when the lady realises she gets really angry and gives the baby to Charles Chaplin again. At the end, we see him quite happy with the baby and we guess he has decided to keep it. In the video we can see Charles Chaplin walking through the street, when suddenly a man drops some trash from a building and hits Charles. He seems a bit angry because of this, nevertheless; he keeps walking and the same thing happens to him again. Then, he takes a little box from his jacket which contains some cigarettes and he takes his gloves off in order to smoke. While he is smoking, he realises that there is a baby crying alone next to him in the floor, so he decides to hold him. He starts looking everywhere for his mother when a woman, all at once is walking with a baby carriage. He thinks that the baby is his son, so he puts the little boy in the carriage, however; the woman gets angry because the baby is not hers. After this, he goes back to where he found the baby and he leaves him there, but there is a police officer behind Charles and when he turns around he holds the baby again because the officer is looking at him. Charles continues walking through the street and he encounters an old man. He gives him the baby with the excuse of checking his shoes, but the only thing he wants is to get rid of the baby, so he escapes and hides in a building. While the old man is looking for him, he founds the baby carriage from before and he leaves the baby there. Charles decides to continue walking, but when he leaves the building he sees the police officer and runs away. The woman who owns the baby carriage realises that there is another baby in her carriage, so when she sees Charles in the street she gets angrier and tells him to take the baby. Finally, he sits in the pavement with the baby and finds a note in the baby's clothes which says \"please love and care for this orphan child\". Charles Chaplin was walking through the street while some women were throwing him something from their windows. It seemed rubbish. After lighting a cigarette, he found a baby next to a rubbish bin. He tried to look for his mum, but he didn't get any result. He thought it may have fallen from a window. Suddenly, a woman appeared running with a baby trolley and Chaplin thought it was the baby's mum. He talked with her about the baby, but the mum replied that he was not her baby. After that, Chaplin tried to leave the baby in the first place he found it, but the police arrived and, afraid about that wrong action, Chaplin decided to take the baby away with him. He decided to leave it with the woman again though, he had the same answer. Finally, he sat in the road huging the baby, and thinking about what he was going to do with it, he found a paper inside the baby's blanket. It was a note telling to love and to look after that orphan child. The protagonist (Charles Chaplin) is walking on the street and gets hit by an object thrown from a balcoon. After that he starts smoking a cigarette and, all of a sudden, he finds a dropped baby next to a bin. He picks the baby but he is constantly trying to get rid of the baby by giving it to someone around (a vagabond and a lady). In the end, he ends up having to stay with the baby, but he smiles and goes on wondering around with the baby. In this video we can find Charles Chapplin on one of his movies. It begins with him walking down the street and getting hit by a trash bin, afterwards he complains about it to the person who has thrown him the bin and when he looks down to the flooor to point the rubbish he notices thaat there is a baby covered in matresses who has been abanoned. Then he decides that he has to pick it up to find out a solution. After this he sees a woman that is in the same street with her baby so he supposses that the baby he has just found on the floor must be hers and he gives it to her and leaves; as soon as he is leaving the woman starts screaming at him because that is not her baby so he has to take it again and find out another solution.\n",
      "Afterwards he sees what it looks like a homeless person that according to Charles is the perfect person to take care of the baby and he jokes him by asking to carry the baby for a second while he ties his shoes, but instead he starts running away and leaves the baby with this randome person.\n",
      "Later on there is a scene in which this person sees the previous woman that was with her baby again and he has the exact same idea of giving it to her assuing its hers, but in this case the woman does not notice and when she finds out the baby is again with her  she sees Charles passing by again and starts screaming at him. Thus Charles has to carry again with the abandoned baby. And in the last seconds of the movie we can see how Charles takes a note out of the matresses's baby which says to take care of the baby Chaplin was rolling a cigarette when rubbish was thrown from the top of a building, then he finds a baby on the floor and puts him on a baby buggie. The woman, who was carrying the trolley, argues with Chaplin because the baby was not hers. Chaplin takes the baby and tries to put him on the floor where he found it. Unfortunately, a police officer sees what he was doing, so Chaplin picks up the baby from the floor. Chaplin finds an old man on a walk and gives the baby to him. The old man finds the woman with the trolley and gives the baby to her, but he drops the scarf. So, when Chaplin was walking, the woman finds him and hits him with an umbrella because she thought it was Chaplin the one who put the baby on the trolley. At the end, Chaplin finds a note and takes care of the orphan baby. The video starts  with a woman throwing trash throughout the window while Chaplin is walking down the street, but he manages to dodge it. He is not that lucky with the second person who's doing the same, and all the garbage falls on him. He seems a little bit upset and shakes off his suit; then, he picks one of the many unfinished cigars he has in his tobacco pouch, takes off his gloves, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking, finally throwing his gloves to the bin next to him. All of a sudden, a baby starts crying, the poor thing is wrapped with sheets next to somebody's trash. Chaplin looks up, left and right, confused. He decides to take the baby when a woman, pushing a pram, is crossing the street behind; he thinks the baby might be hers and leaves him or her inside with the other baby. The woman starts yelling at him/her so, he takes him/her back to where he found him/her. But, a police officer, who's watching, thinks he is abandoning the baby; therefore, Chaplin has to take the kid again in his arms and leaves. He finds an old man, and asks him to take the baby while he fixes his shoe, but he runs away. The old man goes after him but he is hidden.\n",
      "The old man sees the pram half empty and lies the baby there. Chaplin comes out of his secret place and walks the officer again as if nothing would have happened. When he thinks it all has ended, he runs into the woman with the pram and she hits him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby; the presence of the officer in the scene again makes him leave quickly with the kid in his arms, not so sure of what to do. He seats on the sidewalk,  looking at the baby and he finds a note in the sheets the kid's covered with which says 'please, love and care for this orphan child', and he finally keeps him/her. The video consists of one of the first scenes of the movie \"The kid\", one of the most famous movies done by Charles Chaplin. In this scene, Charles Chaplin finds an abandoned child in the middle of the street. Initially, he tries to get rid of him by putting him in the baby carriage of a lady who was walking down the street with her son. However, this lady rejects him with great anger. Next, Chaplin tries to return the boy to where he found him, but a policeman who was passing by there stares at him and he ends up picking up the baby again. Finally, he manages to leave it to a lame man, apparently a homeless man, who decides to leave it again in the lady's baby carriage. When the lady discovers the baby and sees Chaplin go by, she punches him with an umbrella and he has no choice but to pick up the boy again and leave. The video begin with Chaplin walking and trying to avoid bricks that fall from the top of the buildings. He stopped to lit a cigarette and found a baby on the floor next to a trash. He didn't know what to do with the child, so he decided give it to a woman with another baby. He put the baby with the other one, but the woman refused to take care and returned the baby to him. \n",
      "Chaplin was desesperted, and let the baby on the same place where he found. Incidentally, a police man appeared and Chaplin took the baby again. The next time Chaplin  tried to give the baby to an old man, he ask the man for help and when the man is holding the child, Chaplin ran. The eldelry man let the baby with the baby form the woman without she noticed. When she saw the baby, she though Chaplin put him there, and return him to Chaplin with the police help.\n",
      "Eventually, Chaplin decided to take care of the baby. He han founded a note asking about it and telling the baby is orphan. The main character, Charlie Chaplin, has gone for a walk. Since the beginnig we can see that it was not a paceful walk: some bricks started to fall down and almost hit him. However, this was not the worst part. After lighting a cigarette, he finds an abandoned baby next to a trash can. At first, he obviously did not know what to do with the baby. A few seconds later, a woman walking a \n",
      "baby stroller passed by, therefore, he tried to put the baby inside it but he woman did not want him either.

As soon as she saw Charlie, she gave the baby to him again. At the end he keeps the baby. Chaplin was walking down the street and people started to throw rubbish from their windows. After that, he picks up a broken cigarette and a match and starts to smoke. Suddenly, he realises that there is an abandoned baby next a that rubbish bin. He picks up the baby and starts to look for his parents. Charles thinks that he has found his mother but when he tries to give the baby to her, she refuses to take the baby. After that he come across a policeman and the policeman thinks that Charles is abandoning that baby. Charles stays with the baby looking for someone who can take care of him and he does so. He finds a stranger, tells him to hold the baby for a moment and he starts to scape from that stranger. The stranger, now in possesion of the abandoned baby manages to find the same mother that Charles found and tries to put the baby with her. The mother finds out that the abandoned baby is with her again and unluckily for Charles, who was walking in the same place as she was, the unknown mother gives Charles the baby again and he decides to stay with him. Finally, he sits somewhere else with the baby and he finds a note inside the baby clothes. That note basically said that the person who would find that baby should love and take care of him as if he were his father. Chaplin appears into scene walking down a road when some ruins fall on top of him from a roof. After that, he lights a cigarette and realises that there is a baby on the floor of the street. He picks him up and puts him into a baby buggy that a lady is pushing, but that she gives back to Chaplin with anger. He returns the baby back to the place where he found him at the beggining, when a police officer appears forcing Chaplin not to leave the baby there. He finds another man on the street and puts the baby in his arms as he pretends to tie his shoes and then he runs aways. The man tries to chase him but as he can't reach him he also puts the baby in the lady's baby buggy. The lady realises this as Chaplin in passing by in front of her in that moment and thinking he left the baby again she starts to hit him with her umbrella. She advices the police officer and Chaplin has no other option than taking the baby with him. He sits on the street with the baby in his arms and sees a note saying to take care of the orphan child. He smiles at the baby and then he leaves with him. The main character is walking in the street. A street where people drop off things from the windows. Then he stopped because he wanted to take a cigarette from his cigarette box. He was smoking when he realized that a baby was on the ground. He takes the baby and firstly, he thought that the baby was the child of a woman that was passing by. Then, he puts the baby in the pram the woman was carrying with another baby. When the woman saw what was happening, told him that the baby wasn't hers. The man took the baby again and tried to give the baby to another man that was on the street and run away, but that man did the same as him in the first place: he put the baby in the same pram of the same woman. Finally, the woman gave the baby to the first man again (beating him first with her umbrella) and the man, in order not to have problems with the authorities, took the baby again. He found a note with a message written. The message said something like: please love and care for this orphen child. He smiled and hugged the baby. Charles Chaplin was walking when he found a baby on the street. At the beginning, he did not know what to do with him so he gave him to a mother who had another baby but she did not want him. Secondly, a policeman saw him leaving the baby so he gave him to a homeless but this man put the baby again in the mother's pram. At the same time, Charles was walking overthere and this mum thought that he did it, so she hit him with her umbrella. Finally, he took the baby and saw a note saying \"Love him and take care of this orphan baby\" and he tried to do it. This story is about a man who finds a little abandoned baby in the middle of the street. As he doesn't want to leave him or her alone, he tries to give it to someone. At first, he tries dropping him/her in a trolley a women was carrying. However, she notices it and she scolls him, so he tries again with a man who was passing by. Once he left the child with the man, he ran away so that he could get finally rid of the baby, but the man leaves the baby in the trolly of the woman previously mentioned. Unfortunately, the first man (the one who first found the baby) passes next to the woman and he finally keeps the baby with him. In the video we can see Chaplin walking down the street while some neighbours throw rubbish to the street from the windows. He gets mad and insults one person who throws the rubbish directly to him. After this, Chaplin starts smoking until he finds an abandoned baby in the street. He takes the baby in his arms while he starts looking for the baby's parents. Soon he finds a woman who is supposed to be the mother of the child, but in fact she is not. Chaplin continues his journey to find the parents of the baby, finding first a policeman and then a bearded man whom Chaplin tries to give the baby away while running to get out of there the fastest as a possible. The woman that we saw at the beginning finds the baby and angrily chases Chaplin. She hits him with her umbrella forcing him to take the baby with him again. Desperate and without knowing what to do, he sits on the street while carrying the baby in his arms. Even though he thinks about abandoning the baby there, he is no able to do so. Finally he finds a note in the baby's clothes asking for someone to take care and give love to their baby. The video ends up as Chaplin adopts the baby while smiling. Firstly, Charles Chaplin appears walking down the street. He stops for a moment to smoke a cigarette and he discovers a little baby abandoned near the rubbish. At the same moment, a woman cross the same street with a baby in a buggy and Chaplin decides to give her the little baby he has just found. The women refuses and she gives him back the baby. After that, he returns the baby back to where he found him, and a policeman that was around catches him, so he picks up the baby and decides to give him to an unknown person who was having a walk. After giving him the baby, Chaplin runs away. The stranger sees the woman before mentioned and he puts the baby into the buggy. After that, Chaplin sees the woman again. She starts beating him because she thinks that he had put again the baby inside the buggy. After that, Chaplin carries the baby with himself and discovers that he is a orphan child. In this video, Charles Chaplin plays the role of a man who finds and abandoned baby on the street while having a walk. He first tries to give the baby to a woman who already was carrying a little child. She refuses to take care of the infant so he decides to let it alone where he found it. In that moment a policeman comes into the scene and Chaplin fears what the man could think of him. As a consecuence he takes back the baby so that the policeman doesn't think he is abandoning the kid. Right after that he gives the baby to an unknown man. This man finds himself with a baby who doesn't belong to him so when he finds a buggy he left the baby there without knowing if that is his mother's boggie. A few seconds later, Charles Chaplin passes nearby the baby and a woman starts beating himm for leaving the baby on her buggy. Eventually, he takes the baby with him and while cuddling he discovers the child carries a note within him where it says \"Love and take care of this orphant child\". This scene belongs to the film The Kid by Charles Chaplin. At first, it shows Charles Chaplin going for a walk and smoking a cigarette. There is a man throwing rubbish through the window. During his walk he finds an abandoned little baby crying next to a trash bin. He tries to find her mother and tries to give the baby to every single person he finds; first to a woman that is wearing a little child in his buggy. But the woman rejects him because he is not his baby. Then Chaplin decides to left the baby where he finds him, but a police officer appears and decides to carry the baby with him. Later, he sees and old man and leaves the baby with him while he is tying his laces. Then, the old man sees the buggy’s woman and leaves the baby there and run away. The woman realizes that again the abandon baby is on his buggy and sees Chaplin walking over there, so she gives him the baby once again. Finally, Chaplin discovers that the baby is wearing a note that says ‘please love and care for this orphew child’, and he can’t abandon this little child another time. This video is a fragment of one of the famous of Charles Chaplin films. As everybody knows, he made all his works in silent, white and black film. About the video, Charles Chaplin is trying to smoke, when he realises that there was a baby on the flow near to rubbish bins.  He decides to find a place for the child, but he can’t (for example, first he sees a women with a buggy and he leaves the baby there).  Finally, he finds a handwritten note where somebody wrote down: please, take care of this orphan child. It seems that he will look after the child. Chaplin's character was walking around the street when he sees that there's a baby abandoned in the middle of the street. He grabs him and, as he did't know what to do with the poor baby, he drops him or her in a baby carriage of a woman he comes up there. But the woman gets mad about it and Chaplin has to take the baby back and leave him or her back in the street. Then, another man shows up and grabs the baby as well but he doesn't know what to do with him or her, so, again, he leaves the baby in the same baby carriage that he finds while the owner is not looking.

This note says to take care of the baby with love, so that is what Chaplin finally does. Charlot is taking a walk while smoking and some people are throwing rubbish from their windows. He complains about that and stops himself to make another cigarette, but, before continuing the walk, he finds a baby in a corner and takes it.

The police sees him so he tries to give it to a man that is also passing by. The baby ends up with him again, he finds a note saying to take care and love that orphan child so he keeps it with a smile in his face. The story of this video is about a man who finds a lost baby in the street and tries to give him or her to every person that is walking down the street. The main character is rolled by Charles Chaplin, one of the best actors in black and white films. The story starts when Chaplin finds the baby crying on the floor behind a paper bin. Obviously, he takes the baby and tries to calm him or her. However, after a while, he realizes that people are going to say that it’s his baby, and he tries to put in a baby carriage of a foreign woman that was buying in a supermarket. The woman realizes what he has done just in the last moment, and she gives the baby back to him. Then, he tries the same experiment with a poor man that was also walking down the street, but this time he hides behind a wall, and the poor man puts again the baby in the baby carriage of the foreign lady. Unfortunately, when the woman realizes that the baby is in her baby carriage again, Chaplin is just walking near her, and she runs after him to hit him with her umbrella and returns him back. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby, he writes something on a paper, and the story ends with him seated on the ground. In this video Charles Chaplin represents a man who is walking in the street and, suddenly, realizes that there is a baby on the ground. The man doesn't know what to do with this child and tries to put the baby on a buggy, but the woman refuses it because she has already a baby. Then, the man leaves the child on the ground again but a policeman sees him and Charles carry the baby again. He tries to give the baby to and old man and he runs off. This man put the baby in the woman's buggy again. In that moment, when the woman sees the baby, Charles passes through the street and she starts to beat him. He decides to take the baby and he realizes that the baby carries a note with him that says \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". Finally he worries about the child and feels sorry for him, so he leaves with the kid. The video starts with a man throwing bricks or stones from a window, while Chaplin is taking a walk on the street. When Chaplin stops walking to smoke a cigarette, he finds a little baby laying alone on the floor. He picks him up and starts looking around in case the parents of the baby are nearby. In that moment, a woman appears with a trolley and another baby and Chaplin thinks she may be the mother, so he addresses her to give her the baby back. However, the woman says the baby is not hers. Chaplin decides to leave the baby where he found it, but a policeman is standing behind him, so he cannot abandon the baby. Chaplin leaves the place holding the little baby and then, he finds an old man walking. As Chaplin does not want to keep the baby, he gives the orphan child to the man and runs away very quickly. The man tries to follow him, but Chaplin hides himself in a house and, since the man cannot walk properly and moves slowly, he cannot find Chaplin. Therefore, the old man leaves the baby in a trolley he finds on the street and runs away. In the following scene, the previous woman appears again and finds the orphan child in her trolley with her child. Then, Chaplin appears walking, the woman sees him and she starts hitting him to make him take the baby. The argue because Chaplin does not want to take the orphan, so they begin to fight. In that moment, the policeman appears and Chaplin has to take the baby with him. Later on, Chaplin sits on the pavement, looks at the child and discovers a note within the baby's clothes. The note says: Love and care for this orphan child. He smiles and goes away holding the baby, probably indicating that he is going to do so. The video starts with Chaplin walking down the street. He seems relax until he sees that near him on the floor there is a baby crying. He pick up him from the cold street floor and starts to think how that baby could have arrived there. In that moment he sees a woman that is on the street with a buggy and a baby inside of it. So Chaplin decides to carry the baby with the woman and put him into the buggy. But when the women realised what Chaplin have done, she take the baby away from the buggy and bring him back to Chaplin. In that moment, he doesn’t know what to do with the baby so he decides to leave him where he had found him, but when he was leaving him on the ground a policeman appeares and he have to picked him up again. He starts to walk through the streets and he sees a man, so he decides to give him the baby. Chaplin runs away and in that moment it is the man who starts to think where he can leave that baby. He sees the woman with the buggy and has the same idea that Chaplin had, so he leaves the baby inside the buggy. Chaplin that finally had left the baby in another place, is walking on the street and the woman of the buggy starts shouting him because he sees that someone had placed the baby on her buggy again. So Chaplin have to pick up the baby again and he goes away with him. Finally he sit down and looks at the baby and he sees that he has a note inside his clothes which says that he is an orphan baby, so he needs someone to love and care him, so Chaplin stands up and decide to take care of the baby. Chaplin was walking along the street when some stuff began to fall from the buildings nearby. Then, he found a baby who had been left on the street's floor. He picked him up and tried to find the baby's mother.  Suddenly, a mother carrying a with a baby trolley appeared, Chaplin thought it was her baby and put the baby in the trolley, but when the mother came back, it turned out that it wasn't her baby. Not knowing what to do with the baby, Chaplin almost abandoned the child in the same place where he found him, but a police officer appeared and Chaplin took the baby with him again. Then Chaplin tried to left the baby with another man, who again saw the previous woman with the baby trolley and again left the baby in it. When the woman saw Chaplin, she gave the baby back to him. Finally, Chaplin sat on the street with the baby and found a paper with a note on it that said 'love and care this poor orphan child', what made Chaplin keep the baby and maybe take care of him. The story begins with Charles Chaplin taking a cigarette case from his pocket , removes his gloves and lights the cigarette  on scrubbing a match on his shoe , then he  begins to smoke. Straightaway he finds a homeless baby standing on the floor in the middle of the street sorrounded by rubbish and begins to look around in order to see if the baby's mother is somewhere.  He sees a woman driving a baby carriage. The woman looks hurried as if she was looking for something. What happens next is that the woman let the baby carriage alone for a moment so Charles Chaplin runs in the carriage's direction to place the baby he has found in the carriage. The woman cames back and sees what Charles has done , she looks angry as it seems that the baby doesn't belong to her.\n",
      "Charles lets the child on the floor again and unluckily a police man is seeing him so he takes  the child and continues trying to find the baby's mother.\n",
      "Finally he finds a letter hidden in the baby's chest which says \"take care of this orphand child\" , he reads the letter and feels happy taking care of the baby. While Charles Chaplin is walking down the street, people throw rubbish out of the windows. Some trash finally is dropped on him. As a result, he stops and prepares himself a cigarette. Then, he throws his gloves in the bin. What happens next makes him feel confused: he finds a baby on the floor. As a woman comes by with a baby buggy, Charles Chaplin thinks that the baby might have fallen out of it, so he puts him on it with the other child, but the woman gets angry with him and tells him to take his kid and stay away from them. Later, Chaplin tries to return the baby to where he found him, however, as a policeman is watching him, he has to take the kid again with him. Then, Chaplin attempts to leave the child with an old man by faking that he has to tie his shoes and running afterwards. Nevertheless, the old man leaves the child on a baby buggy he founds, which is that from the woman that appeared on the previous scene. When she notices the new baby and identifies Chaplin on the street, she attacks him with her umbrella and makes him take the unknown child with him again. Meanwhile, the policeman observes them. Later, he thinks about leaving the child in a sewer, but refuses the idea and, when he does, he finds a letter inside the baby clothes and discovers that it is an orphan kid. Finally, he decides to keep the baby with him and leaves. The protagonist of this video is walking down the street when he suddenly finds a baby next to some bins. He takes the baby but doesn't know what to do with him. Later, he sees a woman with another baby on a trolley, and thinking that is hers, he gave her the baby, but the woman refuses since he isn't her child. At that point, the proganist is confused about what to do with the child, and even tries to it to a man on the street but unsuccessfully, since the child ends with him again. At the end of the video, he sits with the baby and finds a note among his clothes saying that the child is orphan, and finally, he takes him home. Charles is going for a walk while some builders from the adjacent buildings throw some wreckege. Then, he looks for a box in his pocket to take one of the cigarettes inside. He takes his gloves off, throwing them, and ,after that, he lights the cigarette.  Suddenly, while he is smoking the cigarette, he finds an abandoned baby on the floor. He wonders where the baby came from , but he picks him/her up. After seeing a woman with a baby pushchair, he tries to leave the baby there but the woman gets angry and he has to take the baby again. Then, he tries to leave the baby in the same place he founded him/her but a policeman doesn't allow him. After that, he finds a man in the street, leaves the baby in his arms and he runs away, but the man didn't let himself be fooled by him and, while looking for him, he sees the baby pushchair and puts the baby back. The woman, who sees again the baby in her baby pushchair, gets furious because she thinks that he was the one that did it again, so she attack him with her umbrella and forces him to take the baby again with the help of the policeman. Finally, overwhelmed by the situation, he thinks about dropping the baby into a sewer next to him. After thinking twice about it, he decides not to do it. He finds a note inside the baby's blanket and he decides to pay attention to it. Therefore, he ends up caring about the orphan baby and he decides to take care of him/her. Chaplin was walking along the street while he was smoking quietly. Suddenly he turned around and saw a baby lying in the street, he took it and when he saw a woman pushing a pram with another baby, he wanted to give the newly found baby to her. The woman did not want to and Chaplin took it again. Then, he thought of leaving the baby in the same place where he had found it and just at that moment a guard realized what Chaplin was doing and he did not allow Chaplin to abandon the baby. So Chaplin started to look for the woman he saw before and the woman rejected the baby again. Finally Chaplin read a note that the baby was wearing among the clothes. In that moment Chaplin thought that the best idea would be to take care of the baby himself. Charles Chaplin is walking in the street and as he passes by some trash fall from the windows and almost reach him. He stops to have a cigarrete and founds out there is a abandoned baby crying in a corner. He holds it and put it in a carriage where there was another baby thinking that she lost it.But the mother gives it to Chaplin and he takes it back to the corner , until he sees a policeman and changes his mind. Another man finds the baby and takes it back to the carriage while Chaplin is followed by the policeman. He finally holds the baby again and finds a note saying that is a orphan and that whoever finds it must take care of it Chaplin is walking by the street, close to some buildings under construction. Some rubble is falling from them and Chaplin avoids it. He approaches to the foreground of the image and some rubbles fall over him. He gets angry and yells at the people who are at the top of the building. He lights a cigarette but suddenly something catches his eye. There is a babe on the floor. Chaplin takes him and hesitates, he doesn't know what to do. A woman appears in the background pushing a baby carriage. When she is not looking, he puts the baby into the carriage. She notices and gets mad, yelling at him, threating him. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again from the carriage and walks away. \n",
      "A police officer approaches and stares at him inquisitively. Chaplin goes away because he doesn't want any problems with the authority. He asks a homeless to hold the baby for a moment but it is a lie and runs away.\n",
      "The homeless walks holding the baby until he finds a carriage (the one before). The woman who pushed it is inside a store, so the homeless takes advantage of the situation, puts the baby into the carriage. \n",
      "Casually, Chaplin passes by there. The woman suddently exits the store and thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby in the carriage again. She hits him and yells at him. The police officer approaches, but Chaplin walks away with the baby in his arms.\n",
      "In the final scene, he sits on the sidewalk holding the baby. He thinks about throw it in a sewer, but finally he decides not to do so. He finds some money among the clothes that wrap the baby and a letter that ask him to love the baby. Chaplin smiles and walks away. Chaplin in walking when he finds a little baby, who has been abandoned. Charles tries to get rid of him/her. First, he tries to give him/her back to a lady with a baby carriage. He also tries to deliver the baby to and old man. But a policeman is all the time watching over, and Chaplin has finally to take care of the baby.\n",
      "He finds a note, asking to whoever read it to love and care the orphan child.\n",
      "I think that this story is lovely, although a bit sad, because the baby seems to be treated as an object. Charles Chaplin is kicked out from his appartment, when he listens to a baby who was left in the street.\n",
      "He tries to get rid of him, that's why he tries to leave it at a baby carriage , however, the mother of the other baby gets angry so she gives the baby back. Chaplin even tries to leave the little baby behind, but he's surprised by a police officer, thus, he keeps him. Then, he sees a man walking down the street, so he tries to trick him, albeit the man leaves the baby at the baby carriage again and finally end with Charles again. Finally, he sees a hidden note under the baby's clothes asking to love the baby, so that's what he decides to do. At firts we can see the protagonist, who is Charles Chaplin, seaching a baby in the street, and he try to look for his mother. Chaplis thinks that his mother is a woman who walk near to him, but she wasn't. Later, he tries to put the baby in the street again, but the protagonist saw a police man and he pick up the baby again. After that, Charles gives the baby to an unknown who gives the baby to the woman before, and the woman gives again the baby to the protagonist. Finally, Charles Chaplis realizes that is a baby who his mother was abandoning. This video is about Chaplin, who is a very renowned movie director and actor(specially because his films were soundless). By what I've seen, the plot is about a lonely baby who Chaplin finds in the middle of the street and he starts looking for the possible mother and he gets irritated because he cant get rid of the baby.\n",
      "While he was searching for the solution of the new problem that he had found there he noticed that the baby needs love and he decided to take care of him. At the beginning, Chaplin is walking down the street, but decides to stop and starts smoking a cigarette. Then, he sees an abandoned child and tries to return him to whom he thought was the mother. Nevertheless, it is not her baby and the protagonist decides to leave the kid where he found him, but a policeman sees him and prevents him from doing it. Then, Chaplin intends to give the child to a random pedestrian, who will try to return him to the same mother that the main character saw earlier. However, when Chaplin passes by, the woman gives to him the creature. Finally, the protagonist adopts the child when he discovers, thanks to a note that the child was carrying, that he was an orphan boy. This video starts with some bricks falling from what seems to be a cantiere. Chaplin, who is under it, goes away from. With his typical way of walking, he starts to smoke. As he goes into the nearest part of the scene to us: he makes sure that his walking stick is flexible enough, he recolocates his hat when suddenly some rubbish falls from the sky so he gets dirty. He swears.\n",
      "\n",
      " When he arrives to that part of the scene, he looks at the rubbish bin and also finds out that he only has one cigarette left, which he puts in his mouth. He puts off his gloves and starts a fire with the sole and the match in order to turn on the cigarette. He throws away the match and, as he doesn’t know where he can put his gloves, he throws them to the bin. He shakes his hands and as his is smoking he discovers a baby wrapped in a blanket. He cannot really believe it. He looks up several as he was trying to find out how did the baby had got in there. He looks again to the baby and he takes it as a woman with a stroller is passing by just right behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      " He looks up again and is when he looks down again when he realises that there is a  woman that has just left the stroller in the street while she has got into a shop. The baby might be hers. He tries to call her attention but as it wasn’t successful he goes to the stroller (where there is another baby) and puts the unknown baby inside.\n",
      "When the woman comes out she finds out that a stranger (Chaplin) is putting a baby into her stroller. He tells the woman that she has dropped something (something-> the baby) but the woman does not seem to share his opinion. She starts shouting at Chaplin so he has to take the baby again as the woman leaves with the stroller (in the scene of taking again the baby he nearly took the baby that is not the unknown one). \n",
      "\n",
      "As he cannot take care of him he decides to put the baby again where he found it. He puts it in the floor again but he realised that a police officer was just behind him so takes again the baby and goes away while looking at the police officer. He gets into a different street and he finds an old man walking with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the old man to hold for a minute the baby because he has to tie up his shoelaces. He fakes the action of tiying and when the old man is not looking he runs away. When the old man realises, he also starts to walk quickly after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we are again in the first scenario where we can see Chaplin hiding in a kind of streetwardrove. We see again the old man running with the baby and trying to find Chaplin satisfactorily. However, the old man finds the previous stroller without (the woman is not there) so he decides to put the baby in there and run away. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Chaplin gets out of his hiding place, the police officer is having a walk over there and finds out that Chaplin is there. When Chaplin sees him he goes just the other way round. \n",
      "\n",
      "We can see again the stroller with the two babies while some men are passing by. But, is Chaplin the one who is passing by when the woman gets out of the shop and realises that there are, again, two babies. She sees Chaplin so she takes her umbrella and starts running after Chaplin. When she is near enough she kicks him with the umbrella. She also throws him to the floor and kicks him several times when he gets up. She takes him to the stroller in order to him to take away the baby. The police officer, who his walking around hears the noise so he goes to where they are arguing. The woman seems to be very upset and explains to the police officer in a really effusive way what happened. Chaplin tries also to convince the police officer but he realises there is nothing to do with it so he takes again the baby. He goes away, also the woman does and the only one who stays in the place is the police officer who waits several seconds before leaving the scene. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we can see Chaplin again. He is standing up looking around, like he was wondering what to do. He sighs, he changes the baby’s position and he sits in the sidewalk. When he is sat down he puts away his walking stick. Just right him there is sewer which he opens, looks at the baby and he seems to be about putting the baby overthere but he changes opinion and closes the sewer. He looks several times at the baby, he changes again the position of the baby and he licks his fingers because it looks like the baby has bitten him. \n",
      "He looks inside the baby’s blanket and finds out that there is a paper. He recolocates the lapel of his jacket and he starts reading it. It is a white note where it is written “Please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin looks again at the baby, with love, and puts the note inside his jacket while he keeps looking at the baby. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chaplin smiles, holds harder to the child, takes his walking stick and stands up. He changes direction and starts walking away. Chaplin walks down the street, smoking a cigarett when suddenly something lands on top of him. After that, he lights up another cigarett and he sees a baby on the floor. He picks him up and gives him to a lady with a stroller, assuming that he is hers. The lady, angry, gives him back to Chaplin that tries to fool another man in order to make him keep the baby. But the man puts the baby again in the stroller of the lady, that thinks it was Chaplin again the one who did it. She hits him with her umbrella and tells the policeman. Chaplin picks him up once again and sits with him in his arms in the Street. He finds in the baby's clothes a note that says to take care of him. He smiles to the baby and leaves. At the beginning of the video, I cansee Charles Chaplin walking while he is smoking a cigarette. Also, I can see that some pieces of brick are falling from a building. Then, he founds a baby next to a container. This baby is alone and Chaplin cannot see the baby's mother around there. Next, he finds a woman with her baby, so he may think that she is the mother of the baby he has already found. However, she is not the person he is looking for. After that, he returns to the place where he has found the baby previously to leave him/her there. Unfortunately, I can see a policeman near the place where Chaplin is and I guess that this policeman thinks that Chaplin is trying to abandon the baby right there. For this reason, Chaplin does not leave the bay there and continues walking. Next, he encounters a man and Chaplin asks him to take care of the baby while he is doing something with his shoes. In this moment, Chaplin starts running because he does not know what he could do with the orphan baby. Based on this, I believe that Chaplin tries to leave the man he finds on the street with the baby to avoid himself some problems. Nevertheless, he has to take care of the baby again.\n",
      "Chaplin sees again the baby that the mother was carrying with herself previously, so that he tries again to leave the baby with this woman again, but he fails.\n",
      "Finally, he sits down and reads a paper that he finds inside the clothes of the baby. Someone has written a message for the person that would find the baby: \"love and take care of this orphan baby\". The streets are presented pretty dirty whilst people throw through the window their rubbish. Then, the figure of Chaplin shows up trying to find a cigarette and then lighting it. Just a few moment later, he finds a baby hidden between the trash. He starts to look for someone to look after the baby: he first goes after a woman with another baby and second, a man he finds walking peacefully; not to mention the police following him for his suspicious actions towards the baby. Although, no matter what he does, the baby ends up in his hands. At the end, Chaplin does not know what else to do and sits. He finds out a note between the baby's clothes explaining that the baby is orphan. After reading the note, Chaplin stands up with the baby and walks away. The video shows Chaplin walking by the streets when he suddenly finds an abandoned baby behind the trash can. Then, he grabs the baby and runs into a woman pushing a baby carriage who seems to have lost something. Chaplin approaches the woman and leaves the baby inside the carriage but she refuses immediately since that baby is not hers. Chaplin, confused, grabs the baby again and leaves the woman behind. He thinks that leaving the baby in the same place he found him/her would be the solution, but a policeman appears making Chaplin to stop his attempt to abandon the baby and leaves. On his way, he encounters a man asking him to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes and starts running. Everything was just fine for Chaplin, but little did he spect that the man would place the baby on the same baby carriage he tried before. Unfortunately, Chaplin walks through the same street where the woman mentioned before was and when she sees him she starts hitting Caplin with an umbrella claiming that he was the one who place the baby inside again. The policeman shows during the argument and Chaplin has to take the baby with him again. Chaplin is really frustrated and upset about the situation, he has to take care of a baby that is not his own, but suddenly he grabs a hand-written note asking to love and care the orphan baby. Hence, Chaplin, due to the moving note, decides to keep the baby with him. Chaplin is walking down the street and suddenly he finds an abandoned baby. At first he thinks that the baby's mother is a woman that accidentally walks near there. He gives her the baby but the baby wasn't hers. After that Chaplin decides to leave the baby where he found it but a policeman sees him and runs away with the baby.\n",
      "Then Chaplin tries to give the baby to an old man. This man leaves the baby on the pram that belongs to the woman mentioned before. Eventually, the baby comes back with Chaplin and he realizes by reading a note that the baby is an orphan and leaves the scene with the baby. Chaplin is making himself a cigarette when he is surprised by rubbish being thrown from a building. Then, he finds a baby next to a container, who seems to be alone without supervision. Next, he puts the baby into a  woman's baby buggie but the woman is not the mother of the baby so she returns him to Chaplin. He decides to leave the baby where he was but is surprised by a police man, so he grabs the baby again. DIscreetly, he starts walking with the baby in his arms but as soon as he sees another man he tricks him and puts the baby into his arms, running afterwards. This man finds the early mentioned baby buggie and places the baby on it again. Chaplin, who is walking next to it, is attacked by the woman because she thinks he has left the baby there again. The police man takes part and Chaplin has to take the baby again. At the end, sitting in the paviment, he discovers a note saying the baby is an orfan and he decides to take care of him and keep him. Chaplin comes out. Neighbours are throwing rubbish out of the window and is falling on Chaplin. He does not seem much bothered and takes off his gloves and ligths up a cigar. He later throw his gloves to the rubbish bin. \n",
      "At some point, he saw a baby in a corner of the street, right behind another bin, and hold him up to see him more clearly. Then, he sees a woman with another child and thinks that she might have lost that baby so he places him on the baby carriage. The woman seems upset by this reaction because it is not her baby and hits Chaplin to show her anger and make him go away. As a result, Chaplin goes again to the corner where he found the baby, in order to put him where he was found. However, a policeman saw him and angrily told him not to do so, which makes Chaplin move to another street, where he finds a man and, pretending that he has to tie her shoelaces, he tricks the man to get rid of the baby and leaving him in the arms of this man. This person, in another street, sees a baby carriage and decides to place the baby there in order to get rid of him. However, the woman, when she comes out of the grocery shop, sees Chaplin walking down the street and, again, hits him to show her annoance and make him go back to the carriage and take the baby again. \n",
      "With the baby in his arms, Chaplin is confused and tired. He does not know what to do with the baby. He even thought about placing him in the drain. Nevertheless, he finds a note in the baby clothes. It is written to please love and take of that orphan child. Chaplin, at this point, feels the responsability to do so and decides to keep the baby. There's a man walking in the street who suddenly sees a baby in a corner. He decides to take him and give him to his mother. In that moment, a woman appears and the man thinks she's the kid's mum. He introduces the baby in the baby stroller the woman is carrying with another baby in it, and pretends he has nothing to do with the child. \n",
      "The woman gets angry when she realizes there's a baby next to hers because she has seen the man walking around them and suspects he is the one who has brought that new kid. That's why she starts shouting and tells the man to take the baby. \n",
      "The man obeys and starts looking for another person to leave the child with. He finds a man wandering, gives him the baby, and runs away. Again, the wanderer doesn't know what to do with the baby, and decides to leave him in the baby stroller of the woman already mentioned. He runs away too. \n",
      "However, unluckily, the first man walks around the woman and she thinks he has put the baby next to hers again. She screams and hits him. \n",
      "Finally, since there's a policeman near them, the man takes the baby for the last time. When he sits next to a drain, he finds a note between the blankets of the baby that tells to love and to take care of that orphan child. In the video we can see Charles Chaplin walking down a dirty street while smoking a cigarette. Suddenly, a pile of leaves falls on him, extinguishing his cigarette. Once he lights it again, he discovers a baby behind a barrel. Charles starts looking around for his parents, when suddenly a lady with a stroller passes by and he deduces that the baby is hers. Once he puts the baby in it, the woman notices and gets very angry with him. Charles then decides to leave the baby in the same place where he found him. However, a policeman appears and he prefers to take the baby back to avoid any trouble. Later, he meets an older man and asks him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes. Once he agrees, Charles runs away and hides, willing to get rid of the baby. The older man, without knowing what to do, leaves the baby in the same stroller as before. The woman with the stroller, on leaving the shop, discovers that the baby has been put back there. Just then, Charles crosses her path and the woman, again very upset, hits him with her umbrella. After that, he sits down on the pavement with the baby, and thinks for a moment about putting the baby down a sewer. At that moment, however, he discovers a note among the baby's blankets, asking for the orphaned baby to be taken care of. Finally, moved by the story, it seems that Charles is going to keep the baby. The video starts with Chaplin walking and then he stopped to smoke when he found a baby. He thought that the mother was a lady that was passing by but the woman got angry. Then he wanted to left the baby but a police saw him and Chaplin had to keep the baby.  Then Chaplin tricked a man that couldn't walk, making him to stop and held the baby  and while the man was distracted Chaplin ran away very fast. At the the end the man gave the baby to the first woman and she returned the baby to Chaplin with a lot of violence. Finally Chaplin accepted the baby. Charles Chaplin is trying to smoke but a lot of different stuff fall from upwards. He continues walking and suddenly he finds a baby crying at the street alone. A woman appears immediately after that and he puts the baby into her buggy, but when she realises what he's doing, she picks up the baby out of the buggy and gives it back to him. \n",
      "After a while he continues with the baby in his arms and he wants to leave in the same place where he found him, but a policeman appears, so he decides to run and leave the baby to an old man who gives back the baby to the buggy of the woman who appeared first. Charles Chaplin walks past besides the woman, so she picks up an umbrella and hits him because she thinks he wants to abandone the baby. The policeman appears again, as a consequence, he takes the baby and runs away. He is pretty tired, so he sits down on the pavement embracing the baby and suddenly a note appears from the baby's clothes. Someone asks the person who finds the baby to take care of him because he has no one in this life. Finally, Charles Chapñin stands up and starts walking with the little baby in his hands. Chaplin is walking by a building site and some dirt is falling from the top. Some of it fall over him. He cleans himself and gets a cigar from a box. He lights the cigar and decides to drop the gloves he was wearing to the bin. He keeps walking and finds a baby on the floor. A woman passes by and Chaplin thinks that the baby belongs to her. He left the baby by the other baby the woman was carrying in a baby carriage. The woman returns and doesn't allow him to left the baby. Chaplin returns the baby to where he found it, but a policeman appear and makes him take the baby again. He tries to give the baby to a man who was nearby and the man leaves the baby again with the woman. When the woman realizes that there are two babies in baby carriage again, screams and gives the baby back to Chaplin. In the end, he thinks about leaving the baby in the sewer, but decides against it. He finds a note in the baby's clothes asking to love and care for him. So he decides to keep the baby. A man was walking around in a poor neighborhood when he meet in a corner an abandoned little baby. He looks for the relatives of the baby but he does not success. Firstly, he finds a baby car with a child inside, thinking that he is the baby’s brother he puts him inside but the mother suddenly appears and tells him off he is not her baby. He does not know what to do and as soon as he sees a man through the street he takes the opportunity to give him the baby, but the woman that have been seen him before denounce him to the police and Chaplin had to take the baby again. Finally, seating in the pavement thinking where he can leave the baby, he finds a note that said “care and love this orphan child”. He becomes very affected and decided to keep and care the baby. Charles Chaplin is going for a walk when something hits him in the head. He looks around and realizes that there is an abandonned baby in the street. He picks him up and thinks that the baby is the son of a woman who is carryin a buggy with another baby. He leaves the kid in there, but the woman says it is not hers. He then tries to abandon the baby, but a cop is watching him, so he picks it up again. He then sees a man and asking him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes, he runs away. That man finds the woman and leaves the baby again with her, and Chaplin passes near. The cop is there, and the woman hits Charles and tells the cop that he is abandonning the baby. Chaplin has to take him with him and finds a note saying that the baby must be loved and taken care of, so he finally keeps it. The short film is about a man who found a baby left on the pavement. The more he tried to get away from him, the more difficult it was. Firstly, he bumped into a woman who was walking there with a baby carriage. Then, he left the baby in the carriage as if the left baby had been forgotten by the woman. After being rejected by the woman, he thought about leaving the kid on the pavement again, but when he realised a policeman was looking at them, he took the baby and got around as if nothing had happened. Then, he deceived a old man who was having a walk. The old man was given the baby and Charles ran away. By the time he thought he had get away with it, he bumped into the lady whom he had tried to deceive before. Eventually, he was forced to have the baby. The last scene consists of Charles Chaplin sit on the pavement with the kid on his lap. He read a label the kid had, where it had been written down that the baby was an orphan kid. At the beggining of the video Charles Chaplin is walking along the street, when suddenly someone starts throwing debris through a window. Some of them hit Chaplin on the head and put down the cigarette he's smoking at that moment. He lights another one and then he notices that a baby has been dropped in the middle of an alley. He catches the baby and drops him inside a baby carriage of a woman who is walking down the street with her child. The woman yells at him so he has to take the baby with him. Then he tries to leave the baby where he found it, but a policeman sees him and he catches the baby again. Afterwards he manages to leave the baby to a man who passes by, and that man drops it in the baby carriage of the woman we saw before. The woman thinks Chaplin has done that, and she hits him in the head with her umbrella. Finally, we see Chaplin sitting on the street holding the baby on his arms and reading a note that explains that it is an orphan child. At the beginning of the vide, we watch the famous actor Charlie Chaplin walking when suddenly some rubbish is thrown to him. Then he takes a cigarette  out of a metal box, it's in that moment when he finds a baby layingon the street. Behind him, a mother with another baby appears, so Chaplin thinks that the baby he has found is also hers. \n",
      "Howerver, the woman said to him energically that isn't her baby and she leaves. Chaplin goes back where he foung the baby in the first place to leave baby there, but when a policeman shows up he must keep carry the child.\n",
      "Chaplin cheats on a man who is walking down the street and run away without the baby. This new man drops baby to the woman we've wached before. That's why, Chaplin has to take care again of the baby as soon as he comes across the woman and also because the police officer shows up once.\n",
      "Chaplin ends by himself sitting on the pavement. While he's looking inte the child's clothes, he finds a letter that says \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". Chaplin looks sadly at the baby and finally smile and leaves with baby in his arms. This video of Chaplin is a funny story about a baby. Firstly, Chaplin is walking calmly when suddenly a lot of rubbish falls on him, then Chaplin decides to light a cigarrette with a match. Later, he finds a baby in the middle of the street, he doesn't know what to do so he starts to walk with the baby until he sees a woman with a baby carriage. Chaplin thinks that the baby is likely to belong to that woman so he puts the baby on the carriage but the woman gets angry and she tells him that the baby is not hers. Chaplin comes back to the street and he leaves the baby again on the floor but when he turns around, he bumps into a policeman and as a consequence he picks up the baby again. Chaplin, with a touch of humour, puts the baby on an unkown man's arms and he runs. The unkown man is now confussed but he finds the same carriage in which Chaplin had left the baby before. The man leaves the baby in the carriage like Chaplin and he goes. The upset woman, that has discovered the baby again in her carriage, sees Chaplin taking a walk so she believes that he was the guilty. The woman givesthe baby back to Chaplin. Chaplin, very desperate, doesn't know how to act, he walks with the baby when suddenly, he sees a note among the blankets of the baby, the note says: ''Please love and care for this orphan child''. Chaplin is walking through a suburban neighbourhood in which the ladies of the houses dropped their rubbish to the streets. He decides to smoke a cigarrete and when he looks down, he discovered a baby crying. First, he thinks one lady has left him there by mistake so he put him in her baby trolley with another baby, but the woman refuses to take him since that was not her baby. After that, he tries, to left him in the same place he found him in the first place, but a policeman catches him and he take the baby back. Thirdly, he tries to left him to an old man. This time, he gets to scape but the old man puts him back into the same trolley so, when Chaplin passes by there, the woman hits him with her umbrella and retuns the baby to him. Finally, desparate, he thinks in leaving the baby in the sewers, but quickly rejects that idea. Then, he discovers a letter in the baby's clothes which says that he is an orphan and please, take care of him, and he does. In this video, Chaplin seems to be kicked out of his house, and this is the moment where his journey begins. At first, he is declared to be an 'ackward ass' because he seemed to fall at the very beginning after someone threw him some clothes. Afterwards, while he was walking, after he lighted himself a cigar, he found an orphan baby lying on the floor. He picked the baby up from the floor and walked to see if he could find the mother of the child. He saw a woman carrying another baby in a trolley so he could have thought this was the baby's mother, so he left the child within the trolley. However, the woman yelled at Chaplin, because she was not the mother and probably she could have guessed that Chaplin wanted to leave the baby with her. As Chaplin is rejected, he followed his path to try to leave the baby again on the floor, but a policeman appears just behind his back, so he decides to pick the baby up again as there would be consequences for him. He walked around desesperately so that he could find the parents, but unsuccessfully, he saw the woman again and decided to put the baby on the  trolley, but the woman discovered him and started kicking him until he fell on the floor.  Finally, he decided to sit down on the road and started to think about leaving the child there, but he read the note on the baby's blanket and thoughtfully, decided to keep the orphan after all. While the protagonist is walking and smoking through a street, he suddenly  finds a lost baby. Chaplin sees a mother with another baby and he inmediatly thinks that the baby he has found is also her son, so he give the baby back to the woman, but this person doesn't want the baby due to it is not her son. Chaplin tries leaving the baby in the same place where he found it, but a police man discovers him leaving the little kid alone. After several times in which Chaplin tries to not being with the child, he sees a written note inside the baby's clothes in which Chaplin is told to care and love the baby. Charles Chaplin finds a baby next to a bin. He sees a woman with another baby and he assumes the one he has found is hers, so he dropes it in the baby cart. When the lady calls him out, he grabs the baby he found and goes away. Then, a policeman appears just when Chaplin is leaving the baby where he found it, so he grabs it again and walks away. He sees a man, gives him the baby and run away so the man can not give the baby back. This man, who doesn't want the baby, sees the same baby cart Chaplin found before and leaves the baby there. Just as the woman is finding it out, she sees Chaplin running so she chases him and tells him to take the baby. Chaplin sits on the floor with the baby in his arms and finds a note that says \"Please love and care after this orphan child\". After that, Chaplin decides to stay with the baby CHAPLIN IS WALKING THROUGH A NARROW AND DIRTY STREET. PEOPLE IS THROWING THEIR RUBISH THROUGH THE WINDOWS. THERE IS A BIG CONTRAST BETWEEN CHAPLIN ITSELF AND THE SCENE'S BACKGROUND. THE CHARACTER SEEMS TO BE MORE ELEGANT AND SOPHISTICATED, HE IS WEARING WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE A EXPENSIVE SUIT AND HE  EVEN STARTS TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE. WHEN HE IS ABOUT TO LEAVE THAT STREET, HE FINDS A BABY BETWEEN THE GARBAGE. AT FIRST HE TRIES TO LEAVE THE BABY AT A WOMAN'S TROLLEY, BUT THE WOMAN REFUSES TO CARE THE BABY. THEN HE IS FOUND LEAVING THE BABY AT THE SAME PLACE HE FOUND IT, BUT A POLICEMAN SEES THE SCENE AND THINKS HE ABANDONING HIM. FINALLY HE FINDS A NOTE UNDER THE BABY'S CLOTHES, EXPLAINING THAT THE KID IS AN ORPHAN ONE SO HE KEEPS THE BABY WITH HIM. In this video, a man is walking in the streets when he suddenly encounters a small tiny baby, who has been abandoned on the street floor. Sarcastically, he asks a woman passing by to take care of the creature, and he also hands the baby to an old man who was walking along. Finding that nobody would take care of the poor orphan child, the sir realises that he is the only one that can take care of the creature. Firstly, Chaplin appears walking in a dark street which seems very damaged. Then it can be seen that there are various bricks or something similar falling down on him. But, it appear that someone has taken those objects intentionally to disturb the protagonist of the video. However, it can be elucidated that he does not worry. Therefore, he continues his path along the street. While the scene is happening it can be observed that there is a man next to Chaplin and talking to him. The words that the man is uttering are not distinguisable. Moreover, in the scene there are some break downs to show funny sentences commenting about the pictures. I think that in these comments the character tries to express his feelings. He appears to be careless about the missfotunes he is facing. Next, in the setting the main character finds a poor babby that has been left out in the suburbs. He catchs the baby with himand tries to put the baby in a woman's baby-cart. Consequentlu, the girl returns the unknown baby to Chaplin. She does the later with discontent. Following, it can be seen that Chaplin gives the baby to a random man that is near him. In the consequent scene, the same woman that has returned the baby comes to give back again the baby to Chaplin. Finally, Chaplin tries to throw the baby away. Notwithstanding, he finds a note that express the desire to find a person that takes cares of the baby and he decides to by like his father with affection. Chaplin is smoking but his cigarette puts out, so he lights up another one. Suddenly, he sees a baby crying. The baby is on the floor so he takes the baby in his arms. Behind Chaplin we can see a woman walking with a baby carriage as if she were looking for her baby. Chaplin gets close to the woman and gives her the baby, but he discovers that the woman has a baby already, so the baby that was on the floor is not hers. Chaplin then puts the baby on the floor again but a police officer sees him, so he has to take the baby. Chaplin pretends to have something on his shoe and gives the baby to a passerby. After that, Chaplin runs away. The passerby tries to find Chaplin to give him the baby back, but as he cannot find him, she puts the baby in a carriage with another baby. It was the same carriage as before, so the woman recognizes Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Chaplin has to take the bain once more. Chaplin discovers a note that says that the baby is orphan, so he finally seems to love the baby and he keeps him/her. The video starts with the apparition of the protagonist, Charles Chaplin, whose suit is stained with different construction materials dropped by men at the windows. Our protagonist is pretty concentrated in smoking his cigarette when he sees a baby who is crying on the floor. Charles Chaplin decides to place him in a nearby baby carriage of a woman who passes by, but she doesn’t want to take care of the baby so the woman is pretty mad after realizing it. Without any remaining clue about the parents of the newborn, Charles Chaplin returns the baby to his original spot. However, a policeman appears and he has to take the newborn again. The child keeps on crying, so our protagonist leaves him in the arms of an old man and runs back to hide in the first location, hoping to get rid of the baby. Unfortunately, the old man leaves the newborn in the same baby carriage in which Charles Chaplin had tried to leave him, so when the woman sees him again, attacks our protagonist with her umbrella, calling the attention of the policeman and forcing Charles Chaplin to take the baby again. Desperate, he sits down on the curb of the sidewalk, looking at a sewer to see if the newborn would fit in it, although he abandons that idea soon after. Suddenly, Charles Chaplin finds a note inside the clothes of the baby which says “Please love and care for this orphan child” and, moved by these sincere words, he finally decides to keep the newborn with him. The video is a short film by Charles Chaplin, in which he finds an abandoned baby while he's walking on the street. Then he sees a woman with a stroller, walking around another baby so Chaplin mistakenly thinks that the baby he's just found is hers too. He leaves the baby in the stroller, but the woman fights back at him as that baby is not hers. Chaplin takes again the baby in his arms and procedes to leave him again where he found him in the ground, but the policeman approaches him from his back and tells Chaplin off for abandoning the baby.\n",
      "Chaplin takes the baby once more the baby and in the moment he encounters with another man, he puts the baby in the man's arms and, when the man gets distracted, runs away.\n",
      "The strange man looks strangely at the baby, and as Chaplin did shortly before, leaves the baby again in the woman's stroller, which is stopped in front of a shop.\n",
      "The man escapes, but right in that moment Chaplin walks past the shop and the woman goes running after him and hits him repitedly with her umbrella, until Chaplin takes again the baby from the stroller.\n",
      "Chaplin sits on the sidewalk with the baby on his lap, and discovers a letter folded in the baby's blanket: It turns out that the baby is and orphan and needs someone who can protect and care for him, which Chaplin does in the end of the video. At the beginning, Charles Chaplin is at the corner of an empty and dirty street. Then, he finds a baby that it seems to be abandoned, but immediately a woman with a baby carriage appears. So, Charles understands that the woman is looking for his baby and he puts the baby he has just found inside the woman's baby carriage. The woman gets angry because this is not his baby, so Charles decides to leave the baby where he has found it. When he is trying to leave the baby, a policeman appears so he is forced to take the baby again. While he is walking with the baby, he sees a man and in his attempt to get ride of the baby, he decides to give him the baby . Once again he fails, as the man sees a carriage baby and he decides to put the baby on it. It results that the carriage baby belongs to the same woman that Charles has encountered before, and when the woman sees Charles again, she thinks that he has left the baby in her carriage baby. She calls the policeman and Charles is forced to take the baby again. Finally, Charles discovers a letter which says that the baby is an orphan child who needs someone to take care of him, so he decides to keep him. Firstly, Charles Chaplin appears in the street. Apparently, there are some workers inside some of the buildings that appear in this video. Suddenly, something falls from some of these buildings and Charles get dirty. He gets upset and decides to smoke a cigarette. Suddenly, he finds a baby and he decides to take him. A woman appears in the scene looking for something so Charles decides to give him to this woman. She gets upset because she is not looking for the baby and she thinks thet she is being accused. Charles put the baby where he found him and a police officer appears. Charles decides to take him back and tries to give him to another man. This man puts the baby in the baby stroller and the woman find him. She encounters Charles and she starts hitting him. The police officer appears again but he does not anything. Charles takes the baby back and he finds that this baby has a paper among his clothes. This paper says 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Finally, he feels compassion about him and takes the baby with him forever. In this video, we can see Chaplin is walking around the poor part of the city. He takes one cigarette when he hears the cying of a baby. The baby is lying on the floor, so Chaplin takes the boy and he looks around to find if his mother or any member of the family of that baby is near it. In that moment a woman goes through and Chaplin thought she was the mother of that baby. Chaplin proudly gives the baby to the woman and he leaves. However it's not her son and the woman runs after Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Therefore Chaplin takes again the baby and put him back where he found it. Unfortunately a policeman saw what he was doing and Chaplin, afraid that the cop took him to the jail, takes again the baby with him. He tries to give the baby to a lame man but again did not work. At the end, Chaplin sits down on the street and he saw a little piece of sheet inside the baby's clothes. It says that he was an orphan so someone please take care of him so Chaplin feels sorry for the baby and adopts him. At the beginning of the video we can see a man smoking, walking in a funny way and trying to avoid rubbish that someone is throwing away through the window. However, a second person hit him with the rubbish and annoyed, he begins to prepare another cigarette since the first one is now off. When he finishes, he finds a baby next to a bin and decides to take him. By chance, he finds a woman with another baby and goes to give her the baby he has just found, but the woman tells him to go away with him because the baby doesn't belong to her. After that confussion, the man tries to return the baby back to where it was, next to the bin, but a policeman discoveres him and he takes the baby and goes in another direction. Suddenly he finds another man and lies to him to take the baby because he is supposedly preparing his shoes, but runs away. This new man runs following the other and leave the baby just next to another baby, which is the same one from the woman at the beginning. When the woman comes out of the shop, the first man is passing by and she thinks that he tried to give her back the found baby again so she hits him. After an argument in which the woman tries to force him to take the baby and go away, the policeman comes back and the man has no other option, he takes the baby and leaves. After a while thinking about how to get rid of the baby, the man finds a letter inside of the baby's clothes asking someone to love and care for the baby. He feels sorry for the baby and finally decides to keep him. Chaplin is smoking while going for a walk when something falls on him from the window of a house he was passing by. He takes out his gloves, throw them to the bin, continues smoking and finds an abandoned baby that puts into the baby cart of a woman thinking she dropped it, but the woman gets angry and he has to take the baby, leaving him where he initially was until a security guard discovers him, so he takes the baby with him and ask a man to hold him while fastening his shoes(which was an excuse) and runs away. The other man does the same strategy he tried to do with the woman and she sees Chaplin, hits him and makes him take the baby. He finds a letter in the baby clothes where it is written ''Please love and care for this orphan child'', so that's what he finally does. At the beginning, we see Chapling walking down the street and stopping to take a cigarrete. At that moment, he realizes there is a baby on the floor by a trash can and takes it.\n",
      "Then, he sees a woman with a baby carriage and he thinks that probably the baby fell off it and she did not see it, so he tries to put it back in the carriage but the woman yells at him.\n",
      "When Charles goes back to leave the baby where he found it, there was a police officer looking at him so he pretends to be just taking a walk. Then, he sees a man and asks him to take the baby so he can tie his shoelaces (he does not even have laces on his shoes), but he rans away. \n",
      "In the following scene, the man that has the baby puts it in the carriage of the woman that appeared before while she was not looking and leaves, and in the very moment she sees that there are two babies in the carriage, Chapling is near and she thinks that it has been him who has put the baby in the carriage so she beats him and complains to the police officer. \n",
      "At the end, Chaplin has the baby once more in his arms and sees a note that says that the baby is an orphan and needs someone to take care of him. Chaplin is walking on the street while some women are throwing rubbish from their windows. Once he has insulted the last of these people, Chaplin lights a cigarrette. He throws his old gloves to the rubbish and, suddenly, he discovers a crying baby on the floor. He takes the baby and, while he was thinking that it had fallen from the buildings, he sees a woman with a baby car (with another baby in it). Chaplin gives her the baby, but she agressively refuses him. He is about to abandon the baby where he first found him, but a policeman catches him. Chaplin takes the baby again and this time he gives him to an old man with a long beard. Chaplin runs and hides on a corner. Curiously enough, the old man puts the baby on the woman's baby car, and when Chaplin is walking next to it, the woman discovers the baby. She gets angry and violently hits Chaplin with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby away. The policeman arrives and Chaplin has to run away with the baby. He then sits down on the street and finds a note within the baby's clothes: \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". Chaplin's attitude changes: he kindly looks to the baby, smiles and goes away carrying him. In this piece of the film, Chaplin is walking around in a dirty a semidestroyed street. People is throwing things through the windows, and some of these rests almost fall on Chaplin. He then stops to light on a cigarette and see a baby in the street. He see a woman with another baby in a baby cart and  thinks the one he has found is hers, but the woman say that he is not and think Chaplin is doing something strange with the baby. She fights with him and Chaplin try to leave the baby in the place where he found it, but a policeman appears. Then Chaplin takes the baby again and try to give it to an old man that was in the street. Chaplin runs away and hides in a room, while the old man finds the woman with the other baby and thinks the one he carries is her. Again, the woman say that it is not, and the old man leave in the street. Then, Chaplin finds it again and goes to another place, where he sits down with the bay in his hands and finds a letter that asks for help with the baby. This story is located in a city. There are several characters: Chaplin, a baby, a mother, an old man with beard and a policeman.\n",

      "Chaplin is walking on the street, he passed next to a building from where someone throws away (bricks or something like that). Afterwards, close to the container somebody drops again some waste through the window and almost hit Chaplin. Then, Chaplin lights a cigar (that takes from a tin where he keeps them). There Chaplin realizes that there is a baby next to the container. He seems to think that someone threw it through the window too (like the rubbish). Then a policeman apperars and is observing him; he seems to be afraid of the police. Suddenly, a mother with a baby pass by Chaplin and he tries to leave her the baby but she refuses, she hasn’t lost a baby. So Chaplin takes again the baby, continues walking and when he sees an old man, asks him to hold the baby because Chaplin needs to tie his shoelaces, then quickly Chaplin runs away. Afterwards, the old man  finds a babycar without an adult taking care of it and decides to leave the baby in it. Then, when the mother sees again the baby inside her babycar and Chaplin hanging around she gets the baby back to Chaplin; He accepts to take care of the baby in order to avoid problems with the policeman who watches him. Finally, Chaplin is sitting on the street with the baby on his arms, searches among the baby’s clothes and finds a note that says something like “take care and love this orphand child”. The story finishes with Chaplin leaving the scene happy with her new baby. In the video we may observe Charles Chaplin walking down a street as debris from a construction fall behind him, almost hiting him. Then, someone takes their trash out through the window aiming to a trash can that is on the street, but accidently  all the trash falls over Chaplin. \n",
      "He then decides to lit a cigar, and in order to do so he first takes out his packet; chooses a cigar; puts his cane on his arm as to hold it properly while he lits the cigar; then, he takes off his gloves; takes a match from his pocket, and by scratching a match on his shoe Chaplin lits his cigar; takes the cane right back in his hands, and throws away his gloves. \n",
      "Suddenly, Chaplin is interrupted by the cry of a baby that is near the trash cans, he looks at it closely and looks up as to see if someone had thrown him out through the window as with the trash. Chaplin decides to pick up the baby, and, as he does this, he sees a woman walking by pushing a stroller with a baby in it. Assuming that the woman is related to the baby he has just picked up, he calls upon her and decides to put the baby inside the stroller. Once the woman realizes what Chaplin had done she calls him off and Chaplin quickly decides to take back the baby. Both the lady and Chaplin walk away.\n",
      "Chaplin decides to put back the baby where he found it, near the trash cans. As he is doing this, a policeman stands right behind him, observing him. Right when Chaplin is about to walk  away from the baby he notices that the policeman has just seen him \"abandoning\" the baby, and rapidly understands that the policeman might misunderstand the situation and rushes back to pick him up. \n",
      "In the next scene, we observe Chaplin walking away with the baby as he meets a man in the street. Chaplin decides to trick him by asking the man if he could hold the baby as he ties his shoes. When he starts tying his shoes and the man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin runs away. And when the man realizes what Chaplin is doing he starts chasing him. But, as he loses track of Chaplin, he decides to put the baby in the stroller Chaplin had previously put the baby and runs away.\n",
      "In the following scene, Chaplin gets out of his hiding place and as he goes out he encounters the policeman and he runs away. Then, the woman with the stroller sees Chaplin and figures that he was the one that had put bakc the baby in the stroller and decides to hit Chaplin with her umbrella until he feels obliged to pick the baby up once again. \n",
      "In the last scene Chaplin is seen sitting with the baby and trying to decide what to do with him. He opens a sewer and considers putting the baby inside it, but he finally decides not to do it. Chaplin starts observing the baby and find a liitle not that says \"Please, love and take care for this orphan child\". After having read the note he looks at the baby with tenderness, smiles, stand up and takes the baby with him. Chaplin is walking through a street, when suddenly some rubbish falls on him. He looks a bit angry. Then he takes out of his pocket a metal box where there are several cigars. He takes one and puts it between his lips. Then he takes off his gloves and throws them into a trash bin after lighting the cigar.\n",
      "After that he looks to the left and finds a baby on the floor. He tries to find the baby’s parents, for that reason he gets close to a woman who is walking through the street with a baby carriage and puts the baby into the baby carriage. However, the woman tells him that this is not his/her baby and she goes away angrily.\n",
      "Chaplin decides to put the baby in the same place where he found him/her, but a policeman discovers him. So, he has to catch the baby again. This time he lies to an old man to hold the baby and Chaplin runs away and hides from him. The old man tries to find Chaplin. As he does not do it, he leaves the baby in the baby carriage which we have seen before. \n",
      "Chaplin comes out of hiding and finds the policeman again, so he takes another way. He walks next to the baby carriage and the woman follows him with an umbrella to hit him. They are arguing about the baby when the policeman appears. For that reason, Chaplin decides to takes the baby again.\n",
      "He does not know what to do with the baby and he thinks about it while sitting on the street. Then he finds a note where we can read that someone wants the baby to be loved and care for. Finally Chaplin decides to keep the baby. Chaplin found a baby in an abandoned place so he decides to take him and give it to another person who already has one. The woman notices it and tells him to take the kid to another place so he gives it to the first person he encounters, but the kid comes back to Chaplin again until he saw that there was a letter that said that the baby was an orphan and he deserved some love and care so that Chaplin decided to stay with the baby. In this video we see Chaplin walking around when he finds a baby on the street. He looks surprised but he picks up the baby and thinks what should he do with him. He tries to get rid of it but no matter what he does the baby seems to go back one way or the other to him. The first time he thinks someone dropped the baby but the woman, who already has a baby is suspicious of him trying to abandon his baby and so does the policeman afterwards. At the end he finds a letter saying to look after the baby who apparently is an orphan with no place to go. The video starts with Chaplin passing by these buildings where the tenants throw their garbage through the window, and therefore falling on top of Chaplin. At some point, he finds an abandoned baby next to the garbage bins, he picks the baby up, when he sees a woman with a baby trolley and thinks the baby is hers. Then, he goes and puts back the baby in the trolley, and the woman gets mad because that baby isn't hers, so Chaplin takes the kid back, and returns it to his original place when he is doing so, he runs into a police officer and picks up the baby, again, and gives it to an old man. This old man, puts it back to the same baby trolley from before, thinking that the baby probably belongs there. Once again, the woman sees the same baby in her trolley, while in that same moment Chaplin walks by, and she hits him with her umbrella because she believes that it was him who put back the baby in her trolley. Thus, he picks up the baby, again, sits down on the street, thinks about throwing the baby down the sewerage, but he thinks twice, when he finds a note saying \"love and care this orphan\". The end. Chaplin is walking in the street when suddenly he is hit by a bunch of trash. After that incident, he notices that there is a baby on the ground. Therefore, he takes the baby and goes after the woman and he tries to give her baby back, but unfortunately, the baby does not belong to that woman. After this misunderstanding, Chaplin leaves with the baby and gives the baby to a stranger. The unconcerted stranger carries the baby until he sees a woman with a baby carriage and decides to deposit the baby in it. Unluckily for Chaplin, he runs into the woman and the baby, then the woman recognizes him and gives the baby back. Chaplin, desperate, decides to sit on the ground with the baby and notices that there is a note in the baby's blanket. For his surprise, the baby was abandoned. Finally, he smiles at him and takes the baby with him. Charles Chaplin, walking along the alley, dodges the rubble thrown from the windows. When he hears a baby crying, he looks up at the buildings as if the child had been also thrown out from the windows. Them, he takes the baby and tries to leave him with an old man, but the man refuses to take him. Immediately, he puts the baby with another baby in a carriage, but the mother does not want two babies. Finally, he sits with the baby in a passage and he finds a note left in the baby's clothes, “please care for this orphan child.” He looks at the baby fondly and takes him. Charles Chaplin is walking down the street while people are throwing away some rubbish. He is quite annoying as he is getting dirty because of the dirty things people are throwing. He stops for a second to light up his fag. Suddenly, he sees a baby in the street. The baby is left there with some blankets. Charles looks everywhere to see if someone is missing a baby. Behind him, a woman is seen. She is pushing a pram with a baby inside. Chaplin suddenly thinks that this other baby is also her baby so he leaves the baby in the pram. But it isn't her baby. He catches the baby again and when he is about to leave him where he found him, a police appears. He walks away with the baby. Then, he sees a man and gives the baby to him. This man leaves the baby again in the same pram that has previously appeared. Charles walks next to the pram and the woman starts hitting him with the umbrella because she thinks he has left the baby again. He picks up the baby and sits with him in the pavement. He finds that the baby has a letter which says \"take care of this orphan baby\". And they both together go away. In the video, we can see how Charles Chaplin gets into trouble (as he normally does). This fragment has been taken from the movie 'The Kid', and I am going to sum up what I saw.\n",
      "Charles Chaplin was going through a street when suddenly he found a baby behind some trash bins. Not knowing what he should do, he starts to go around, with the baby on his arms, trying to find him a place to stay. But he realises that another baby's trolley, an old man's arms, or the same place where he found him, are not the best options, as there is a policeman around, and he does not want himself to be accused for something wrongly. At the end, desperated, he sits on the street and discovers that the baby has a note within his clothes which begs love and care as he is orphan. So Chaplin, apparently, takes care about this poor baby and takes him home. The video is a clip that belongs to an old Charles Chaplin film. It is black and white and the only sound to hear is the music that follows the actions of the characters. The few times we can \"hear\", actually reading\" what they may say, is in slides that occationally appear. The protagonist, who walks in a silly way along a street, feels anoyed when someone throws things, through the window in the building next to him, and as a consecuence, hitting him. After that, he stops to relax and looks for a cigarrette to smoke. He burns it and start to smoke. Then, he finds an orphan baby and looks for his parents. At the same time, a woman carrying her own baby passes by and the protagonist, who thought that he might be the baby's mother, puts him next to the other baby in the babycar but the woman refuses to keep it since it was not hers. Next, the protagonist thinks of leaving the baby where he found it but a policeofficer enters and the obviously couldn't leave the baby. Looking for another option, he sees another man walking and asks hi to hold the baby while he \"mends a problem he had with his shoes\" but runs away leaving the baby with that man. Now it is his problem. However, that man did not know what to do either and found the same babycar with the previous baby in front of a shop and leaves it there. Then, the mother goes out and finds the baby next to hers and tries to find the person who left him there, when the protagonist appears again and the woman, very agressively, gives the child to him again. He doesn't know what to do and sits on the street. He tthinks on leaving the baby underground but he refuses the idea. Finally, the finds a letter in the baby's clothes telling to whoever would find him to love and take care of that orphan child. The protagonit happily stands up and goes away with, now, his own baby. Charles finds a stranded child near some trash and tries to get rid of him as soon as possible. First he leaves it on a baby trolly with another child but the woman that is strolling it argues with him and tells Charles to grab it and go away. Then, he tries to leave the baby right on the spot he found it. However, a policeman stops him and intimidates Charles in order to pick up the baby. Sooner rather than later Chaplin turns left and locates an old homeless man and gives him the little child just to trick him. Running away, Chaplin hides himself from the old man. Nevertheless, this homeless man finds once again the same baby trolley of that women from before and leaves the child on it. In an unlucky turn of the events, Chaplin walks in front of that trolley only to find out that the baby is there and has to pick him up because of the rampaging behaviour of that mather and also of the previous police officer from before who threatens him. Later, in an exhauster condition, decides to seat in the sidewalk, just to come across with a note between the messy dirty bed sheet in which the baby was covered. \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". This was the emotional message written down on that crumpled paper, which made him take the decission of keeping the baby. Chaplin is walking down the Street when suddenly a trash bin falls over his head. After this unespected attack he finds that there is a child abandoned near the rubbish. He takes the child and try to put the child in a carritou with other baby but the mother of the other baby arrives and attacks Chaplin. After this Chaplin tries to give the child to an old man but that is useless and the child returns to his arms. then he tries to leave the child on the ground in the middle of the Street but a pólice officer arrives and Chaplin has to take the child again. at the end he sees a Little piece of paper that said :love and care for this child .He feels responsable and he feels pity for the child and he decides to carring him home . The video begins with Charles Chaplin walking down the street when suddenly some bricks almost hit him because a person throws them out of the window. He keeps on walking while he is smoking a cigarette, and he is attacked again, but this time by a different person who throws his or her trash out of the window. Chaplin seems a bit angry; however, he checks a box he is carrying with him in order to smoke another cigarette again. Once he starts smoking, he takes off his gloves and decides to throw them in the bin next to him. Just when he throw them away he hears some noise, like a baby crying, so what he does is to turn around and sees that there is a baby alone in the street wrapped up in blankets. He begins to analyse the situation and looking everywhere because leaving a baby in the street is a very cruel act. While he is taking the baby with him, there is a woman with a baby carriage walking behind him. Chaplin sees her so he walks towards her with the intention of leaving her the baby. He leaves the baby in the carriage and the woman beings to argue with him because the baby is not hers; therefore, Charles has to take the baby with him again and wants to leave him in the place where he found him. However, at that moment a pollice officer appears behing him and sees what Charles Chaplin is doing. He is caught in the action and the policeman believes he is abandoning his baby. When Chaplin sees the officer behind him, he quickly takes the baby with him again and starts walking down the street. He runs into a man and gives him the baby with the excuse that he needs to tie his shoes, so he is pretending he is doing that when all of a sudden he runs away. The man notices what Chaplin has done and goes everywhere looking for him but he cannot find him because he is hidden. That man fins a baby carriage in the street so he decides to leave the baby in it and runs away. Chaplin leaves his hiding place and walks next to the baby carriage exactly when the woman appears and sees the new baby in her carriage. As she sees the baby, she sees Chaplin too, so she thinks that the one that let the baby there was him and not the other man; therefore she follows him and starts hitting him with her umbrella. The policeman observes the situation and the woman argues with him and with Chaplin, so he is forced to take the baby with again. He sits down in the pavement next to a sewer and watches it with the intention of leaving the baby there, but finally he does ot do that. He checks the baby and fins a letter in the blankets that says \"please love and care for this orphan child\". Then, the video finishes with him looking at the baby and smiling at him. In that video Chaplin starts to walk calmy on the street. He is walking around when he decides to light a cigarrette. In that moment, he sees a baby that is on the ground, next to a bin. He wonders why the baby is alone there. For this reason, when he sees a women that is with another baby, he thinks that it is a good idea to leave the baby next to the other. But the women sees the action of Chaplin and she says to him that she doesn't want to take care his baby. Chaplin takes the baby again and, now, he decides to put on the same place that he has found it. However, a policeman sees him doing this and he has to take it and go away with him. Suddenly, he sees a man that is walking around on the street. He thinks that it is a good idea to ask him if it is possible that he held the baby one second while he puts on his shoes. He does it, but he starts to run away when the boy is helding the baby. This boy realises that Chaplin has lied him and he decides the same that Chaplin had decided it before: put the baby in the \"baby car\" of the other woman. When the woman sees the baby again, she looks for Chaplin and starts to hit him with the umbrella. In that moment, the policeman appears again and Chaplin and the woman stop. The video ends with Chaplin reading a piece of paper that is found on the baby clothes. In that note Chaplin reads that he has to take care the baby like it was his baby. So he decides to do it. Charles Chaplin is in a poor neighbourhood. He finds an abandoned baby. At first, he thinks that the woman with the baby trolley has dropped him. He puts the baby in the trolley. The woman sees the baby and tells him that's not her baby. Chaplin takes the baby back, and tries to get rid of it in different ways without being caught by the police. But at the end, he finds a note that says that the baby is an orphan and decides to keep it. This video tells the story of a man called Charles Chaplin who finds a baby in an industrial city. Charles is poor man who  was having a stroll and smoking  when he found an abandoned kid on the floor. He tried to give the kid to a woman that already had her own baby. The woman tell him off for doing that and Chaplin ran away. Then, he tried to leave the kid in the same place where he found him. But surprisingly,  a policeman was there and didn't let him leave the child. After all, Charles faced the situacion and decided to look after the child. There is a man walking on a deserted street when he suddenly founds a baby crying on the floor. At the beginning, he thinks that the baby belongs to a woman who is pulling a baby carriage. However, she gets angry when the man leaves the baby in the carriage, so he has to get the baby back. He tries several times to get rid of the baby, but he can not. Finally, he reads a note that was it the baby's clothes, in which someone asks to take care of him, and the man decides to adopt him. A man walks along an empty street, surrounded by abandoned houses and buildings which are actually falling into pieces. To his surprise, after being hitted he founds a solitary baby in a corner of a building.\n",
      "The man totally shocked unsuccessfully tries to look for the baby's mother. suddenly, he sees a woman with a buggy and puts the abandoned baby inside of it. \n",
      "However, the woman gets angry with him because the baby is not hers. The man also tries to leave the baby with another old man who was also walking along the street but it was another failure.\n",
      "After all his possible ideas had been a failure he sat on the pavement with the baby a found  a note in the child's clothes which said : take care and love this orphan. Reading this note changed the man's feelings towards the baby and put a smile upon his face. In the video we can see Charles Chaplin walking down a street, while people throw the trash out the window. Suddenly, a bag full of rubbish hits him and he gets very angry. Then, he takes a metallic box from his pocket which is full with cigars, puts one in his mouth and and lights it.  After that, he takes his gloves off and throws them into a litter bin. He keeps walking but suddenly he finds a baby crying on the floor. He takes the baby in his arms and takes a look around to see where his mother is. Then he sees a lady walking with a baby in a stroller and Chaplin puts the baby he found in the stroller with him. He tells the lady she has dropped the baby, but she tells him that the baby is not hers and leaves very angry. Then, Chaplin takes the found baby and puts him in the place where he found it. In the meanwhile a police officer watches him, so he has to take the baby again and keep walking. Then he finds an old men, gives him the baby while pretending he is tying his shoes, and runs away. The old men, then follows him and finds the same lady with the stroller where he leaves the baby and runs away. When the lady sees Chaplin passing by, she thinks he has put again the baby in her stroller, so she attacks him with an umbrella. Then Chaplin is forced to take the baby with him and they sit together on the street. Finally he finds a note under the baby's clothes where it read that the baby was orphan, so he decides to take care of him. One morning, a gentleman with a peculiar hat and a moustache walks by the side of an alleyway, he is thrown debris and litter by the rude neighbours. In a halt, he stops to light a cigarette, and suddenly he realises that there is a small baby abandoned in the street. Where did that baby come from? Immediately after, he tries to leave the baby on the stroller of a nearby woman. Is the newborn hers? She complains and leaves. Then, the gentleman goes again to the corner he found the baby and he gently places the little creature on the pavement. Soon, he regrets his choice by seeing a policeman just behind his back. He takes the baby and walks away, he approaches to an old bearder man and tries to give him the child by distracting him. The curious hat-man runs and runs. He hides from the bearded man. Again, the same stroller appears and the old man is tempted to leave the baby there. From a near shop, the woman comes out and thinks that the hat-man gentleman has for a second time left the baby in her stroller. Angrily, she bets the gentleman again and again with the help of an umbrella. Few seconds after and the policeman appears and the gentleman is forced to take the baby with him. He carries the baby through an alley and sits down. He hesitates what to do with the little one, but then he finds a paper note that triggers his feelings. \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". He smiles and takes the baby in his hands. Charles Chaplin is walking down an alley smoking and construction pieces keep falling on his head. He then insults whoever is throwing that stuff at him and proceeds to open a box where he keeps half-way smoked cigarrettes. He takes one out, takes off his gloves, lights the match with his shoe and lights the cigarrette. He throws away his gloves and he notices a baby crying, abandoned. He picks up the baby and sees a woman with a baby car and tries to call her. She does not hear him so he leaves the baby in the baby car and tells her she has dropped the baby but she yells at him and tells him that is not her baby. He picks up the baby again and tries to leave it where he found it but a police officer sees him and he has to pick up the baby again. He runs into a man and indicates him that he needs to tie his shoelace and gives this man the baby. Chaplin pretends he is tying it and then he runs away. The man sees the above mentioned baby car and puts the baby there. Chaplin runs into the policeman again and then into the woman hits Chaplin with an umbrella and the woman tells the officer it is Chaplin's baby so he has to take it again. He sits down and sees a sewer, opens it and thinks about throwing the baby but he does not. Then he finds a note that says \"please love and care for this orphan child\" and Chaplin smiles at the baby and takes it with him. The main argument of the video is Charles Chaplin trying to lumber people with a baby. At the beginning, Charles Chaplin discovered the lonely child crying his eyes out in the street. Although he decided to take the baby, he changed his tune and firstly tried to leave the baby in a stroller together with another baby. Obviously, the mother noticed and left the scene immediately after without the baby. Later, Chaplin tried to abandon the baby at the very same place where he was found. A policeman saw him and he was forced to take the baby again. Two more attemps were done in order to get rid of the baby. Finally, Chaplin, who was totally desperate, is sitting down the street and he discovered a paper inside the blanket covered the baby body. The baby was orphan and somebody should take care of him. Eventually, Chaplin is out of scene carried the baby smiling. Chaplin is walking down the street in an apparently poor neighborhood when some \"awkward ass\" drops a bunch of garbage on him from a window. Then Chaplin stops, shakes the dirt off his shoulders and lits a cigarette as he looks down. There, in the floor, he sees a baby inconsolably crying wrapped in a piece of clothe, he grab the baby and, trying to figure out where does he come from, sees a woman with a baby in a pram, so he guesses she's dropped it, putting it back in the baby carriage. Nevertheless, it is not the woman's baby so she get mad and tell him to take it away, so he tried to get rid of the baby tricking an old man but the baby end up back in the woman's pram. She punches Chaplin with an umbrella and he goes away with the baby, under the sight of a policeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "     When he's desperate about what to do with the baby (apparently planning to throw him in the sewers) he founds a note within the clothes which says: \"Please love and care for this orphan child\", so he keeps the baby and go away with him Chaplin was walking near a construction site evading debris falling down but eventually gets hit and drops his cigar. After picking a new one from his case, takes out his worn-out gloves and lights it. After walking for a while finds a baby lying on the floor, crying. He picks it and, after seeing a woman walking by with a baby stroller, he thinks that child may be hers, so Chaplin puts it on her stroller. Charles argues with her, as it wasn't her baby, and when Chaplin tries to leave the baby where it was, a police officer sees him, with an inquisitive look so Chaplin walks away with the baby to find an old man, and tricks him to pick the baby while he ties his shoes, so he can run away. The old man, after finding the same atroller as Chaplin, leaves the kid there and walks away. The woman who was pushing the stroller finds the baby there, surprised, and when Chaplin is walking nearby, she hits him with her umbrella and forces him to take the child, with a little help from the silent police officer. After a short walk, Chaplin sits on the sidewalk near a sewer, and thinks about trowing the baby away, but eventually finds a note saying it's an orphan child, so he pities the baby and takes it with him. The main character finds in a street corner a baby. After preparing a cigarette, he  moves the baby to a woman's baby cart, where another baby was. Afterwards, the woman gave him the baby back. Then, the main character gives the baby to a man who was going for a walk, and that man puts the baby in the baby cart of the woman again. The woman sees the baby again and gives the man the baby back. Then he founds a note inside the baby's clothes asking for love for the baby, who do not has parents. The video is a short-film of Charles Chaplin. The story revolves around the character of Chaplin, who is walking through a street. There, passing through where he is thrown garbage and trash he finds a baby crying in the floor near the bin. Chaplin trying to find the little one's home, give him to a lady who is taking a walk with her own baby. She yells at him and he tries to leave him in the same spot he found the baby in first place. Then, a policeman finds Chaplin trying to leave the baby so he takes him back with him and leave the baby with a lame man. The man, manages to leave the baby with the lady again and she grabs her umbrella and strikes Chaplin in the back, thinking that it was his doing again. In the end, Chaplin thinks about leaving the baby in the sewer but finds a piece of paper within the baby's blanket. It says that whoever who finds the baby, to take care and love him. In the end, Chaplin decides to keep him while he plays with him. Once upon a time, a man called Charles Chaplin, was walking around some dirty and old place where the people who lived there were throwing rubbish, all the time, through the window. He decided to stop and smoke a cigarette but then, he found a baby on the floor. The very first thing he thought was about to carry him and go to find his family but the search wasn't so easy. \n",

      "Finally, that man let the baby in the trolley of the former woman, the one who hit Charles, while she was in some kind of shop but when she got out and find the baby, she returned him to Charles. \n",
      "When Charles Chaplin saw that he couldn't get ride of the baby, he found a note saying that the baby was an orphan child and the person who left him wished all the love and care for him. Chaplin was taking a walk and smoking when suddenly he found a baby abandoned in the street. He saw a woman with a baby carriage and he thought that the baby was hers, but she said to him that it was not, so he decided to leave the baby where he had found it, but he couldn't because a police officer was watching him. Then he asked a man to grab the baby for a moment, and he ran away. The man with the baby couldn't find him, so he left the baby in the baby  carriage of the woman, and she returned it again to Chaplin. Finally, he found a note which said that the baby was an orphan, and he decided to keep it. Charles Chaplin is smoking while walking down an old street full of rubbish. Suddenly, some bricks from above fall on him. Then, he opens a box of cigarettes and he starts to smoke another one. As he looks down, he sees a baby next to a bin. He holds the baby in his arms and looks around, trying to find his relatives. Since he didn't find anyone, he left the kid in another baby's buggy. However, a woman (probably the other baby's mother) came out of a house very annoyed and gave the child back to Charles Chaplin. He tries to get rid of him/her by going back to the place where he found him. When he places him on the street next to the bin, a police officer sees him, so Charles Chaplin holds the baby again. He gave the baby to an old man who can't walk very well, and then runs away. The old man left the baby in the same baby buggy. The woman came out again, very angry, and exactly at that point Charles Chaplin was walking next to the buggy, so she kicks him and returns the kid to Chaplin. He takes the baby with him to another place and sits down. He found a note with the following words: \"please love and care for this orphan child\". Then, Charles Chaplin hugs the baby while smiling at him with love. A man (Chaplin) is walking and smoking along an Alley in a construction site (or demolition one). Suddenly, somebody throws some garbage on him… for a second time. So he yells.\n",
      "After he swaps away the dust from his coat, he takes from his pocket a small box containing some used cigars. Then he lights his cigar by scratching a match on his shoe’s sole. Therefor he takes his gloves off, which he throws away in a barrel as well as the used match.\n",
      "Then he looks down and finds a Baby Child on the floor. He looks around and sees a woman pulling a baby cart, so he brings the baby in the cart. The woman yells him and impels him to take the child with him. He tried to put the baby on the floor again, but a policeman is near so he has to take the baby up again and walk away. After turning the corner he sees another man walking, an old man. He tries to cheat the man and leaves the baby on his arms and runs away and hides himself. Then the old man watch the baby cart nearby and puts the baby inside… and runs away.\n",
      "The woman sees the baby again in the cart and then sees Chaplin passing by, so she forces him to take the baby again. He tries to avoid the situation, but the policeman is coming again. So he must take the baby with him. Then he finds a note inside the baby’s clothes: “Please love and care for this orphan child”. He is finally moved to take the child with him, and walks home. At the beggining we can see Chaplin walking around and smoking while somebody is throwing rubbish from their windows. He hits a bin ang while he is watching what there was in that bien he suddenly sees a baby crying on the floor. At first, he thinks that the mother might be a woman who is walking around  so he puts the baby inside of her baby car baby carriage but she is not the mother so she gives him the baby back. Afterwards, Chaplin gives the baby to a random man who again puts the baby in the baby carriage of the first woman. When she sees the baby again in there, she beats Chaplin. Finally, Chaplin finds a  note in the baby's blanket that asks for love and care for the poor baby and Chaplin smiles at him and leaves with the baby in his arms. In the opening scene we see Chaplin, an impoverished man, walking In a lower-class area interrupted by what it seems to be rubbish falling on top of his head, thrown by a person calling him an “awkward ass”. Disrupted, stops to smoke a cigar when he spots an abandoned baby crying. Surprised by the incident, he tries looking for the parent of the child when woman passes by with a stroller trying to hand off the child, but failing since it is not hers. Chaplin attempts to leave the baby where he first found it, but yet again fails due to the police observing him. Leaving, he makes his final attempt to get away from the baby, he ask a favor to a bearded man to hold the child to clean his shoes, however he makes a run from it. The bearded man leaves the child in a stroller, coming to find out it is the same from earlier. Chaplin walking by is attacked by the same women, forcing Chaplin to take the child. When sitting down, he finds a note written by the parent saying “please love and care for this orphan child.” Reading that letter, he feels sorry for the baby ultimately, decides to keep and raise it. A man (Charles Chaplin) was walking in the street and decided to pick a cigarette when he found a baby that was alone so, he decided to carry him or her. Later on, he saw a woman carrying another baby and while the woman entered a shop, he put the child he found in the trolley next to the woman's baby. When the woman left the shop and found the child, she became surprised and returned the strange baby to the man. As he didn't know what to do with the baby, he decided to leave the child where he saw him/her for the first time. Nevertheless, a police officer appeared and probably thought that the poor man was trying to get rid of his own baby so, he had to keep the child with him. Chaplin was thinking about a possible manner of leaving the baby without causing him/her any harm when he saw a man wandering. Even though the man seemed to be homeless, Chaplin gave him the baby because he was unwilling to have a child's responsibility. The homeless man saw the woman again so, he thought as Chaplin did and ran away. Few seconds later, while Chaplin was walking nearby, both the officer and the woman recognised him as the man who carried the baby before and gave the baby back to him. Eventually, he decided to sit a little bit as he got so confused that he didn't know where to go with the baby. A man dressed in a suit is walking through the street when someone throws trash at him from above, without giving it importance he lights a cigarette. Suddlenly, he sees something on the ground; he finds it is a baby wrapped in clothes. He is overwhelmed and tries to leave the baby in a baby trolley. The woman, probably the mother, returns the baby to him. A police officer is walking around at the same time, making sure that everything is alright. As a last resort, he gives the baby to an old man walking around and flees; unluckily, this man tries to put the baby in the same trolley as the beginning and the woman, once again, returns it to the protagonist. At the end, the man debates between accepting the newfound orphan baby and abandon him once again, this time permanently. This baby has its story told since the beginning, its fate is written. That person will grow without the love of a family to whom he is no burden to; that person will have a very difficult future. And no one cares. Not the maternal figure, represented in the woman, who has a baby herself. Not the policeman, who subtly wants the man to keep the orphan because it would be easier than doing it himself. Not its parents, that are absent and just leave a note asking someone to take care of their child. And, of course, not the protagonist, who finds himself between the road of empaty or selfishness. And at the end, so do all of us. Chaplin wearing a tiny hat and a cane leaves a house. When he gets out, he sees some wreckage falling down the first floor. He starts shouting. Then, he takes a butt from his pocket to smoke. \n",
      "Suddenly, he sees a baby crying on the floor. The little boy is completely alone. Chaplin takes the baby into his arms and looks for his mother. He sees a woman carrying a baby trolley and he puts the baby there. As the woman is not his mother, she tells him what is happening. She is fairly angry. Chaplin takes the baby and the woman leaves. In that moment, a police officer appears and he sees Chaplin putting the baby on the floor, next to a rubbish bin. The police officer tells him something like “what are you doing?” Therefore, Chaplin very scared, takes the baby again and leaves the place. While he is on his way, Chaplin finds an old man. He gives the baby to the old man and runs away from there. The old man looks for Chaplin because he doesn't want to care for the baby. As this man doesn't find him, he leaves the baby in the baby trolley again. When the woman realises what has happened, she goes nuts. She finds Chaplin and she starts hitting him with an umbrella. \n",
      "At this time, the police officer appears again and the woman explains to him the problem. Chaplin takes the baby and he sits on the pavement. Chaplin hugs the little boy and he discovers a little piece of paper hidden in the baby’s blanket. It’s a note which says “please love and care for this orphan child”. He realises that the little boy doesn't have parents and he tightly hugs him. Finally, both people, the baby and Chaplin, leave the scene. It's a comical sequence of Charles Chaplin by which he finds himself smoking in an alley when he suddenly sees a baby standing on the floor. He picks up the baby, and tries to give it to a woman passing by with her own baby. The woman rejects taking care of the baby so Chaplin picks it up again, and tries to return it to the previous place where he found it. However, a police officer catches him in the act so he picks up the baby one more time. Going down the street, Chaplin sees a man and tricks him to hold the baby while Chaplin ties his boots so that he could get out of there without the baby. This man, trying to find Chaplin, sees the same baby carriage where Chaplin had unsuccessfully left the baby the first time, and leaves it there. The woman, furious about this, tries to find a solution when, unfortunately for Chaplin, he passes by in front of the woman. She chases him with an umbrella to pick the baby and carries it with him. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby since anyone else is willing to do it. Charles Chaplin is walking down the street, an alley to be more precise. As he is walking, he is smoking a cigar and trying to avoid the trash the neighbours are throwing out of their windows.However, he is suddenly hit by a pile of trash and he can't help but curse the person who did it. Then, he decides to have another cigar and takes one from the metal box he has in one of the pockets of his jacket. He takes a match from another pocket and lights it up with the help of his shoe. As he is doing this, he is surprised by a crying baby who was left down on the ground. Confused, Chaplin tries to get rid of the baby but he is unsuccessful, and the policeman forces him to keep the baby. However, Chaplin finds a note inside the blanket wrapping the baby that says \"Love and care for this orphan child\" and this makes Chaplin decide to take care of the baby. This is a video in which we can see Charlie Chaplin in a dark comedy sketch about a baby he finds on the streets while walking around. When he find the baby for the first time he is overwhelmed by the situation and try to get rid of him by giving him away to an old lady who is taking another one to a walk. The lady catch him in the moment and he is forced to take the baby again. He later tries to put the baby where he first found him, but a policeman catch him too. After that he gives the baby to a beggar who, just after that, put the baby in the same carriage Charlie tries at the beggining. He meets for accident the lady again and he is blamed again even if he wasnt the culprit this time. Finally, he sits with the baby more calm and look at the baby, and he finds a note with him that reads as the baby is an orphan who is looking for shelter. Knowing that, Charlie get up to go to the orphanage, and the video stops. Chaplin, who seems to be a homeless person, is walking around the street. Suddenly, he finds a baby abandoned. He doesn't know who this baby belongs to, but he tries to give him to a woman who is passing by with another baby. This woman doesn't seem to be very happy about the idea, and ask Chaplin furiously to take the baby back.\n",
      "Again, with the baby, Chaplin tries to leave it in the street in the same place when he found it. Unfortunately to Chaplin, a policeman sees him and doesn't allow him to abandon the baby.\n",
      "After two more attempts to get rid of the baby, Chaplin finds a note asking him to take care and love the child, and that makes Chaplin to change his mind and keep the baby. This video is a fragment of a movie. The main character is a wandering man, played by Charles Chaplin, who finds an abandoned baby in a slum. \n",
      "Not knowing what to do with him, he sees a woman with another baby passing by and he thinks the kid is hers. Due to her reaction, he realizes he is wrong and returns the baby to the place he was before. At that moment, a policeman is keeping an eye on him, so he must find another way to get out of the baby's problem. Straightway, he gives the baby to another wandering man and flees. \n",
      "This new character seems to think the same and drops the baby in the first woman's buggy. As we believe all this coincidences are ending, the main character appears again walking near the buggy. The woman and the policeman, who is there too, recognize him so he must carry the baby again.\n",
      "Finally, when he feels exhausted about this issue, he discovers a letter from the abandoned baby's mother and he is moved by what it is said, therefore he stays with the kid. This is one of those famous black and white short films with Charlie Chaplin as the main character. At the beginning of the film we see him walking down the street while he is smoking and suddenly he stops to ligh another cigarette. He takes off his gloves and looks around to find, surprisingly, a newborn baby laying on the floor. He doesn't know what to do when he sees an old lady , so he goes and drops the baby into her carriage. However, the lady gets mad and she gives back the baby to Chaplin. Later, he tries to leave the baby at the same spot where he found it, but a police officer sees him so he tried again by gaving the newborn to a random man who was patiently strolling. Then this man returns the baby to the same lady and the baby ends in Chaplins hands again. He gives up and keeps it. This video is a fragment of a film called “The Kid” starring Charles Chaplin. At first, we can see Charles wandering around a poor neighbourhood, when all of a sudden a pile of rubbish is thrown at him. He does not take this into account and proceeds to light up a cigar. Suddenly, he notices that a baby is lying in the ground. Since a woman is walking by with her child, Charles thinks that the baby he has just found is hers. Therefore, he places the baby in the stroller. Nevertheless, she responds angry to Charles owing to the fact that the baby does not belong to her. As a result, he has to take the baby again with him and decides to leave him back in the place where he found him. However, a policeman discovers what Charles aims to do. Despite the fact that he cannot leave the baby there, he eventually finds a man who he asks to hold the baby for a second, which gives Charles time to escape. This man chases Chaplin but he finds a stroller, where he leaves the baby. Charles comes out of the place in which he had hidden and finds the policeman, so he has to run away again. Nevertheless, Charles passes by the stroller and the same woman he had previously encountered tells him furiously that the baby is not hers. Consequently, he has to take the baby. Finally, Charles sits on the ground holding the baby when all of a sudden he finds a piece of paper in which it is asked to please take care and love the poor child. In the end, he decides to take the baby with him and love him. A tramp is walking towards the camera from the background. In spite of his worn-out clothes, he looks pretty classy and elegant: he is wearing a black suit and a bowler hat, and also uses a cane. After having been beaten by some rubbish that have fallen from a window, he searches for a cigar, takes one of the fag-ends that he keeps in a cigarette case, and, after taking off his ragged gloves, he lights it with a match and throw the gloves away. Suddenly, the tramp finds a baby who is weeping desperately on the floor next to some bins. \n",
      " \n",
      "He picks him up and looks up to see if the baby has fallen from a window too. Then, a woman with a pram passes in front of them and the tramp runs to her to give her the baby, since he thinks she has dropped him accidentally. The woman, who already has a baby of her own, seems to be really upset with the tramp and tells him that that baby is not hers, so the tramp takes him back and put him in the same spot where he found him. However, a police officer is just behind him and the tramp picks up the baby again from the floor. After that, he asks a bearded man to hold the baby for a moment so he can lace his shoe, but that is just a trick to get rid of him and run away. Next, the bearded man follows the tramp to give the baby back to him, but does not find him and puts the baby in the woman’s pram instead. When the woman finds that the tramp’s baby is in her pram again, she hits him with her umbrella, the police officer arrives and she accuses the tramp of abandoning the baby, so he takes him back. \n",
      "\n",
      "The tramp does not know what to do with the baby. He sits on the sidewalk for a moment and thinks of dropping him in the gutter, but repents of it. Then, the tramp finds a note hidden in the baby’s clothes: it asks whoever who find the baby to love and take care of him. After reading the note, the tramp smiles cheerfully at the baby and walks away with him. The protagonist of this black and white short film is walking down a narrow path between ruined buildings when he finds an abandoned baby all wrapped up on the ground. He does not know what to do with it until he sees a woman carrying a trolley with a baby in it. He hurries up to her and puts the found baby in the trolley thinking it might be the woman's as well, but she makes him take it out angrily. He then decides to place it back on the ground, but a police officer shows up, forcing him to keep it. A lame man suddenly appears and the protagonist leaves the baby to him and rushes off without saying anything else. The lame man puts it back in the same woman's trolley. Finally the protagonist is found by her and is happy to keep the orphan baby after reading an explanatory note it was carrying in its clothes. There is a man who is walking down the street. He runs into a baby who has been dropped from a balcony and he puts it back into a baby buggy thinking that the owner of the buggy was the mum of the baby. This woman gets angry and he takes the baby in order to put it where it was originally taken from. After that a cop sees him causing him to take the baby again and he ends up giving it to a stranger and running away. The stranger puts the baby in a baby buggy which happens to be the same baby buggy the first man had put the baby into. Then, the woman bumps into the first man and beats him because she thinks that it had been him who had put the baby in the buggy. The man is forced to take the baby again. The man, who is fed up with the situation, thinks about throwing the baby into a gutter, nonetheless he does not do it. In the end he finds a note which says \"care and love for this orphan baby \" and he is moved by it. He decides to take care of the baby. The video shows the story of a man, played by Charles Chaplin, that finds an orphan baby crying on the floor when we was just going for a peaceful morning walk. After trying to get rid of him numerous times; by placing him in random mother's pushcahir or tricking an old man into carry the bay while he ties his shoelaces; and failing, the protagonist finds a note that says \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". Suddenly, this discover seems to change his mind and happily decides to keep the baby. Charles Chaplin is walking when he sees a baby by the rubbish bins. He picks the baby up and tries to make a woman take it by saying 'You dropped something'. This woman is carrying another baby and tells him that that is not her baby so that she cannot take it. She probably thinks that he is trying to get rid of it. After that, he gives the baby to a random man who is also walking and who also tries to leave the baby with the previous woman. When she comes out the establishment, she finds the baby and sees Chaplin passing by, so she thinks it is him who has done it again. The woman hits him and shouts very angrily. Defeated, Chaplin takes the baby and then is when he finds that there is a note under the wrappings which reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan baby'. Finally, he decides to keep the baby. The clip starts with Chaplin walking around ruined buildings when suddenly an amount of trash fall on him. Bothered by the situation, he takes a cigarette from his case and looks around him trying to find the responsible of that action. While he is looking, he notices that, behind him, there is an abandoned baby lying on the floor. A confused Chaplin distinguishes a woman walking down the street with a baby stroller and, therefore, he runs towards her leaving the baby in the troller. When the lady notices about this, she gets mad since she does not recognise the baby. Chaplin and the woman argue and rapidly he comes back with the baby to the place where he found it. Then, he leaves the child again on the floor abandoning it. However, when he tries to escape, a policeman witnesses him. Chaplin takes again the baby and runs. During the chase, he leaves the baby with an old man but, subsequently, the old man leaves the baby with the aforementioned woman and then disappears. Unfortunately for Chaplin, the woman sees him again and assumes that he is the one who has left the baby in the stroller, then the woman, violently, punches him. Chaplin is forced again to take the baby and run. Apparently exhausted, he sits down in the pavement holding the child. Then he notices that within the baby’s clothes there is a note with a message that confirms that the baby is an orphan child. Finally, he opts to adopt it. The short clip starts with Chaplin walking down an alley, seconds latter a bunch of rubbish falls on him and he complains looking up to what we asume to be the person that threw it. He decides to open a can with cigars that are in bad conditions and lights one up. As he keeps walking down this alley he finds a baby and wonders who might have left it there, he decides to pick it up and at that moment a lady in the background appears with a chariot. Chapling thinking it might be her baby tries to put the baby inside the chariot but the woman is mad so I is clear that the baby is not hers. He picks the baby up and tries to  put it where he found it but a policeman sees him so he decides to pick it up again.\n",
      "He walks with the baby till he finds an old man and with the excuse on tying his shoes he leaves the baby with the old man and runs away. The old man sees the woman with the chariot and again tries to put the baby in it. Chaplin sees the policeman and runs in the other direction getting caught by the lady that thinks he tried to leave the baby with her again and proceeds to hit him. The policeman is watching again so Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. Not knowing what to do he sits down with the baby and thinks about hiding it in a sewer. He takes pitty on the baby and reeds the note that was left with it. The mother asks in the note that someone takes care of her baby and loves it so Chaplin decides to keep it and the scene fades to black. At the beginning, we can see Charles Chaplin walking in the street when, after an incident, he finds out a newborn baby on his way and decided to take him/her. Later, when he saw a mother with a buggy and her baby, Chaplin thought the baby he found could probably be hers and put him on that same buggy, but the woman said it was not hers and Chaplin took the baby back again. Thus, he tried to leave this kid back on the floor but he picked him up as soon as he noticed there was a police near him. Worried because of having this small kid, he convinced a man to take him/her for a while while he fled. Unfortunately for Chaplin, this man put the baby back on the mother's buggy without being caught by anyone. Hence, when the mother saw Chaplin again, she made him to take the baby out of his buggy. Finally, this hopeless Chaplin, sat down with the kid on his arms, realized that this was an abandoned baby left with a note. After reading it, Chaplin changed his mind about the baby and we can imagine that he looked after the baby as the paper he read only asked for this baby to be loved as he had been abandoned. In the video, we see Charles Chaplin walking around. Bricks are falling off the windows of the buldings, when he gets hit by some of them. He stops to take a cigarette out of a case and, suddenly, he sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks up the child and realises that, behind him, there is a lady pushing around a pram. Chaplin thinks that the baby must be one of her children and tries to place him in the pram. The lady reacts furiously and obliges him to take his child away. \n",
      "Not knowing what to do, Chaplin comes back to where he found the baby and attempts to leave him there again. However, a policeman appears and he is forced to take the baby with him. He decides then to give it to a bearded man who was passing by. The man, who suddenly realised that Chaplin was running away, also tries to get rid of the baby by putting him inside the pram of the woman mentioned before. By chance, she left the stroller unattended while making an errand, so the bearded man has the opportunity to leave the baby in the pram and run away. \n",
      "Chaplin, who thinks that he finally could get rid of the baby, passes by the pram when the lady is finding out that she has two babies instead of one. Again she blames Chaplin and starts hitting him with her umbrella until he takes the baby with him and goes away. \n",
      "He is despaired up to the point of considering leaving the child in a drain. After discarding that option, he realises that there is a note among the baby's clothes. It says: \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". Chaplin, moved by these words, starts feeling bad about the poor baby. He decides finally to do what the note says and takes the child with him. Chaplin is walking on the street. In the middle of an alley he finds a little baby abandoned. He doesn't know what to do with him/her. He starts thinking and he sees a woman with a pushchair and a baby on it, so he tries to leave the litlle one he has with the woman. When she discovers what he is trying to do, she shouts at him and give him the baby back. Chaplin returns to the alley in order to leave the baby where he found her/him but a police officer sees him and Chaplin decides to keep the baby with him. He tries to mislead a tramp giving him the baby, the man sees the same woman with the pushchair and leaves the baby with her. Chaplin meets again the lady that thinks it has been Chaplin who has tried once again to give her the baby and beats him with her umbrella. Chaplin takes the baby one last time with him and finds out he/she is a little orphan reading a piece of paper the little one had hidden in the blanket. In the end, Chaplin decides to keep the baby with him, loving him/her and taking care of her/him. This film, called The baby, was made by Charles Chaplin and released in 1921 in the USA.\n",
      "As we can see at the beginning, the main character is going through one street where rubbish is being thrown. These citizens who are carrying out this activity are neither aware nor worried about the fact that anyone might be passing by. We are shown this evidence as Chaplin avoids the first one but ends up being thrown the garbage of another person. After this event, which provoked his cigarette falling down, he decides to take another and start to smoke it. This having been done, he finds a baby left on the floor. At first, he thinks he might have been dropped from one of the windows by accident. When he sees a woman with a cart and baby, he thinks the child is hers, so he goes closer to her and tries to leave him in the cart. However, the woman appears after having left the cart and tells him that he is not her son.\n",
      "Then, he returns to the place where he found him and tries to abandon him, but a policeman shows up. When Chaplin realises that he has witnessed his act, he takes the baby again and leaves. \n",
      "Now in another street, Chaplin finds an old man and thinks this is a perfect opportunity to get rid of the baby. Then, he lies to the man and runs away as the old man shouts at him. Chaplin having left, the man moves on to another street with the baby, where he finds the cart of the woman seen before in the movie, and leaves the child there. At this moment, Chaplin, who thought everything was over, reappears, but he is noticed by the woman, who has discovered the unknown baby in her chart. She then hits him and tells him off because she thought he had been the one who had left the baby in the cart.\n",
      "After this funny episode, Chaplin moves on to another place of the city and sits down on the pavement. When examining the child, he finds out a piece of paper, where he reads that the author begs of the person who found the child love and care towards him. Eventually, he decides to look after the child and the film ends. Chaplin was walking down a sketchy street when he found a crying baby laying on the ground. He soon saw a woman with a stroller and thought that baby was hers, so he put it in; however this was not the case and she gave it back to Chaplin. He then put the baby back where he found it but a police officer caught him red-handed so Chaplin picked it up again. He kept on walking until he saw an old man with a walking stick and left the baby with him. This old man found the  lady with the stroller and put them back in. Chaplin passed by and the lady thought it had been him again who had left the baby there, so she hit him with her umbrella and made him take the baby back. Finally, Chaplin was sitting and found a note in the baby's clothes which said to love and take care of them, and so did Chaplin. Chaplin is walking down a street, smoking cigarettes taken from the floor and angry because people are throwing their rubbish through the window. Suddenly, he finds a baby on the floor, looks around, and sees no one, so he decides to pick the baby up. He walks holding the baby and sees a woman who appears to be looking for something, and Chaplin puts the baby he had found on the woman's trolley, in front of the woman's child that was already on it. However, it seems the baby found by Chaplin is not the one the woman was looking for, so she reacts violently against him and makes him go away with the baby. Then, Chaplin decides to leave it where he found it, but, right when he was about to do so, a police officer appears and Chaplin has no option but to pick it up again to avoid having problems with the police man. Chaplin then walks again holding the baby, and to get rid of it, he tricks an old man pretending he ties his shoes while Chaplin makes him hold the baby, but runs away insted. Due to a series of some funny coincidences, Chaplin has problems again with the woman he had met before, and with the police man as well. Next, he sits on the sidewalk, thinking what to do, and finds a note within the baby's clothes that says it is an orphan baby. Eventually, he realises the baby has no home or family, and that it is not lost, and he finally decides to keep it. At the beginning we see Chaplin walking down a road when someone suddenly hits him with rubbish thrown from the window. After that, he gets out of his pocket a metal box from which he takes a cigarrette end that he lights and starts to smoke. He intends to continue walking, but a baby wrapped in sheets calls his attention. He takes the child in his arms and thinks what to do while a woman passes by with a baby trolley and goes towards her, thinking that was her baby. But it wasn't, so the woman angrily tells him to take the kid and go and so does Chaplin. His next idea is to leave the kid in the same spot he found him, so whoever had lost him could find him, but a police officer sees him and thinks he is abandoning the baby so he takes him again and leaves. Desperate, he finds a man to whom he asks to grab the baby and, while he pretends to tie his shoelaces, runs away and hides. At the same time, the other man leaves the baby in a baby trolley he finds in the street, which is by chance the same woman's one. Chaplin gets out of his hideout and when the woman sees him, she hits him repeatedly and starts arguing with him to take the child. In that moment, the policeman comes and Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. At the end Chaplin sits to think what to do and finds between the baby's sheets a note asking to take care of him since he is an orphan. Chaplin gets up and finally walks away with the baby. Chaplin is walking, when, suddenly, some rocks fall from a building and almost hurt him. He complains. Then, he takes a cigarette. While he's smoking, he sees a baby on the street. He takes it and looks for someone who could have left it there. As he doesn't find anybody, he leaves the baby in a pram he notices. But the pram's woman complains and holds him the baby again. He tries to abandon it on the street, where he found it, but a police man sees him, so he tries to escape, not to get caught by the police man. After that, he leaves the baby with a man, who puts the baby into the previously mentioned pram, and the pram's woman gives the baby to Chaplin for a second time. Eventually, Chaplin sits down and looks at the baby while holding it, when he notices about a hidden paper in the baby clothes. He takes it and reads the message written: the baby is an orphan kid. Chaplin smiles. At the beginning of the video we see Chaplin walking in a relay dirty street where people seem to be throwing rubbish from the windows of the buildings.  As he keeps walking some of the rubbish falls on him. He opens a metal box in which we see several almost finished cigars. He chooses one and lights it. At some point he sees a baby laying on the floor, next to more rubbish. He is quite surprised and looks at the windows wondering if anybody has thrown the baby from a window. He takes the baby in his arms and tries to figure out what to do with it. Then, when a woman with a stroller passes by, Chaplin leaves the baby inside the stroller. However, as soon as the woman realises this, she scolds him and Chaplin has to take the baby again. Later on, he tries to leave the baby on the floor where he had found it but the presence of a police man makes him keep the baby. After that, he tricks someone to hold the baby and runs away. This man who is now holding the child decides to leave it in the same stroller as Chaplin did before. Hence, when the woman with the stoller sees Chaplin, she beats him up and returns the baby to him (now Chaplin cannot get rid of the baby as the same police officer is watching him).  At the end Chaplin sits in the street beside a sewer with the baby in his arms. He watches the gutter considering if the baby would fit in there but decides to keep it in his arms. When he is looking at the baby, he finds some money and a letter in its clothes. The letter says “Please love and care for this orphan child”. So, we see how Caplin gets emotional and decides to keep the baby. He gets up with a smile on his face and leaves. The first scene shows Chaplin walking down the street, trying to avoid the bricks that fell from the houses. Unfortunately, he is hit with some bricks and decides to smoke a cigarette. \n",
      "He finds a crying baby who is laying on the floor and picks him up. He thinks he found the mother of the baby and procees to return him. The woman gets angry because that is not his child. \n",
      "Chaplin tries to return the baby to the floor but a police officer appears, forcing Chaplin to take the baby with him. \n",
      "He then fools an old man to keep the baby and run away. The old man gets rid of the baby placing him in the woman's craddle with her other child. As the time the woman finds out that the baby is there, Chaplin is walking down the street. The woman chases him and forces him to take the baby. \n",
      "The scene ends with Chaplin discovering a note that asks him to take care of the baby, and so that he does. One day Chaplin was walking down the street when, suddenly, someone threw a bag of garbage at him. He stopped to light a cigar and, when he was about to leave, he saw a baby next to the trashcan. He decided to pick it up and find the person who had left him there. In that moment, a woman with a baby stroller was passing by, and he thought that it was hers', so he walked to her and left it in there. However, it wasn't hers', and she started yelling at him. He decided to run with the baby and leave it where he found it, but the police showed up at that moment and he had to pick it up again. As he saw that there was no way to leave it behind, he decided to trick an old man by asking him to grab the baby while he tied his shoes, and then run away. The old man found the woman Chaplin had seen before and left the baby in her stroller again. When Chaplin thought the problem was solved, he passed by the woman again, and she called the police, so he had to take the baby again. Hopeless, he sat in the street walk and thought about dropping him in the sewer, but then he found a note in the baby's blanket. He then realized that he was alone in the world and that it was destiny that put it in his life. In the beginning we can see Charles Chaplin walking by the street. Suddenly, while he is walking through an alley, some debris falls from a building. He shakes off the dirt from his clothes and lights on a cigarette. While doing so, he finds a baby on the floor. Confused, he picks up the baby. He sees a woman passing by with a baby trolley for twins, so he decides to put the baby he has found next to the woman's. When she sees him doing so, she yells at him and tells him to take that baby away. He decides to put the baby back where he found him, in the alley, but he realises there is a policeman looking at him, so he takes it back from the street again. He sees a lame man using a walking stick passing by, and with the excuse that he is going to tie up his shoelaces, he gives the baby to the man, and then runs away. The man runs after him, but Charles Chaplin hides so he doesn't see him. The man then sees the same baby trolley Chaplin had seen before, and decides to put the baby there. The woman realises the baby is there again, and coincidentally Chaplin is passing by, so she yells at him. The policeman sees the two of them arguing so he goes to bring peace. Charles Chaplin is forced to take the baby again. Not knowing what to do with him, he sits on the sidewalk and considers throwing the baby down the drain, but does not do so in the end. He finds a paper between the baby clothes that reads: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. So, in the end, moved by that note, he decides to keep the baby. There is a man walking down the street and, suddenly, a flowerpot crashes down on the ground right in front of him. As he is grunting about what has just happened, he takes a cigarette butt out of the tin box he keeps in his pocket. After taking his gloves off, he lights a matchstick with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking the butt. When he is about to set his journey again, his attention is driven to a baby lying on the floor, all wrapped up in blankets. He then sees a woman with a stroller, and he decides to follow her carting the baby in his arms. He tries to make the woman believe that she has dropped the baby out od the stroller, but she does not seem very convinced about that idea as she starts yelling at Chaplin. Then he returns to the same place the flowerpot landed on and he restored the baby to where he found him or her. \n",
      "\n",
      "At that very moment, a police officer sees Chaplin leaving the baby behind and so Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. As he strolls down the road, he pretends to need to lace his shoes and he entrusts the baby to a man in the street. When that man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin escapes and hides from the man who is chasing him. This latter man also sees that very same woman from before and leaves the baby in the stroller once again, but the woman thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby inside the stroller and not the bearded man. After being beaten up with an umbrella, Chaplin takes the baby once more, but this time under the watchful eye of the police officer and he leaves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chaplin, resigned, sits down on the pavement, and takes a letter from the wrapped baby. The letter says: “Please love and care for this orphan child”. It seems that Chaplin was moved by this short note as he leaves with the baby in his arms. The video starts with Charles Chaplin taking a walk and he gets hit by something due to some works that are being done in the houses nearby. After this, he realises that there is a baby on the floor. He looks around confused and takes him. Chaplin observes there is a woman with a buggy and another baby, so he approaches her and places the baby inside it with the other child. However, the woman gets mad because the baby is not hers. Then, Chaplin takes the baby back to the place where he found him and leaves him on the floor. While he is leaving the baby, a policeman is watching him, so Chaplin takes the child back. Following this, he starts walking again holding the baby. He gives the creature to an old man, pretending he is going to lace his shoes, and runs away. This old man, confused as well, leaves the baby in the buggy again and he goes away. The mother comes out and looks surprised at the child. Then, she sees Chaplin walking by and assumes he was the one who left the baby again, so she hits him with an umbrella. The policeman comes and Chaplin ends up taking the baby. He sits on the floor while holding the child and thinks of putting him into a drain. Afterwards, he reads a note the baby had in his blanket. It sort of touches him and thus, he finally decides to take care of him. Chaplin is walking as a builder throws rubble from an apartment above. He cleans the dust off of himself and continues walking and smoking a cigar. Suddenly, someone throws rubbish to him from above. He stops, swears at the person above and takes a can out of his pocket that contains several half-smoked cigars. He takes one, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and throws his gloves to the bin. He looks to the left to discover a crying baby who has been abandoned on the street. He approaches and checks on him. Then, he looks at the surrounding buildings looking for the possible parents of the child. After seeing nobody, he decides to grab him while a woman with a trolley passes by. Chaplin notices the woman and chases her. When the woman stops to enter one of the houses, Chaplin leaves the child on the woman’s trolley just to see her come back yelling at Chaplin. The woman tells Chaplin, very angrily, that the baby is not hers, so Chaplin grabs the baby again and the woman leaves. Chaplin returns to where he found the baby and leaves him/her there again. When he turns around, he bumps into an officer and immediately turns around to take the baby and leave. As he is walking by, he sees an old man walking with a stick. Chaplin tells the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe. When the man holds the baby, Chaplin pretends to tie his left shoe and a second after he runs away, leaving the man with the baby. The man chases Chaplin, who hides in a small room next to where the baby was found. The old man, not being able to find Chaplin, leaves the baby on the woman’s trolley. Chaplin exits the room where he was hiding and comes across another officer. He turns around and leaves. In the next scene, two people walk by the trolley and the woman goes out of the shop. The woman sees the baby on the trolley and shows herself incredulously. Chaplin passes by the woman, who takes an umbrella and runs to him. She starts to beat him with the umbrella. She grabs him by the jacket and takes him to the trolley. They start an argument about the baby and the woman calls an officer. The woman explains the situation to the officer and Chaplin takes the baby again, without the officer telling him to. They all leave. Chaplin walks on the sidewalk and drops his stick next to a drain. Then, he sits on the sidewalk to pick up the stick. He opens the drain and looks at the baby, thinking about dropping him inside. He frowns and closes the drain. He stares at the baby and starts talking to him/her. When the changes the baby to his right lap, Chaplin stabs himself with a pin that is on the baby’s blanket. He looks into the folds of the blanket and finds a note, which was held with the pin. He takes out the note and pokes the pin on his blazer. He unfolds the note, which reads “please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin, moved by the note, looks at the baby and keeps the note in a pocket of his blazer. He starts smiling at the baby, takes his stick and they both leave. As Chaplin was walking through the street several things happened to him. First, a person was throwing things out of the window and they almost fell on him luckily he was able to avoid being hit. Then as he was walking away while smoking a cigarette someone else threw something out of their window and part of it hit chaplin, he just wiped himself and lid another cigarrete and threw away his gloves. When he was about to leave he saw a crying baby laying on the floor next to a dumpster, chaplin looked around to see who had dropped him and picked him up. He saw a lady with a stroller and he called out to her but she just ignored him and went into a building, so chaplin just put the baby into the stroller and walked away, but the lady started yelling at him to take the baby back and he was pointing that he found him back there but she was not listening to him, so chaplin took the baby out of the stroller and walked back to where he found him. He was about to put him back in the ground when he saw a policeman, so he just grabbed the baby and took him with him, and he saw an old man walking and made him hold the baby while he ¨tied his shoe¨and chaplin ran away leaving the baby witht he old man. The old man put the baby in a stroller where chaplin had already attempeted to leave the baby, and the old man ran away. The lady saw chaplin casually walking and she started beating him with an umbrella. He took the baby back and sat on a sidewalk with the baby, he contemplated dropping him in a sewer but instead he looked inside the baby's blanket and saw that he had a note. Charles Chaplin was walking in a street surrounded by run-down buildings. Suddenly, he found an abandoned baby accidentally. He did not know what to do. Just after that, he saw a woman with a baby cart and tried to give the baby to the woman. Nevertheless, the woman rejected taking care of the baby and gave him back to Charles. He tried to leave the baby where he was, but a police officer saw him. Therefore, he thought of another solution. He gave the baby to another man who was passing by. Then, Chaplin runs away. The man found the woman with the baby cart and left the baby there. Then, Chaplin walked next to the baby cart and the woman and the police officer saw him so he took the baby back again. Finally, Chaplin sat next to a sewer and found a note inside the baby’s clothes and decided that the baby would stay with him. This video shows a peculiar situation where the main characters are Chaplin and a baby. First of all, it is a silent and black and white film which was a very typical thing in those years. The scene stars with Chaplin in the street where he found a baby lying on the floor. Then, a policeman thought that the baby belonged to Chaplin so he had to pick up the baby from the floor. After a while, Chaplin tried many times to get rid of the baby but he did not. Eventually, he found a note where said that the baby was an orphan one, so he decided to take care of him. Through the whole scene, it can be seen that the first option for the actor is to leave the baby wherever. Besides, the first part is more like a comedian one, although when he realised that is an orphan child, the scene is more dramatic. At the beginning of the video, we see a man walking down the ally when someone throw  him some rubbish. He cleaned himself and then chose a cigarette to smoke. \n",
      "After this, he was continuing his walk, when he suddenly saw an abandoned baby near the trash. He didn't know who the parents were so he started looking around until he found out a woman with a baby cart. He dediced to leave the baby there thinking, maybe, it was hers. However, when the woman found out, she started yelling at him. It seems that it wasn't hers.\n",
      "Because the man didn't know what to do with the baby, he went to the same place he found it to leave it there. Suddenly, a policeman appered so he couldn't do that. He left the place and saw an old man walking. He gave the baby to the old man and run off. \n",
      "The old man dind't wanted the baby so he walked until he found a baby cart (the same as before) and leave the baby there when the mother wasn't looking. With all the bad luck, the man was walking in the street when the mother descovered the baby. She chased him and yelled at him. In this moment, the policeman appeared and started yealling at him too.\n",
      "In the end, he picked up the baby and took it with him. He sat down in the street and found a letter inside the baby's clothes that asked to please take care of that orphan baby. He then, realizing it didn't have a family smiled at the baby and took it home with him. Chaplin is walking on a street and trash is thrown down onto him from above. He opens a pack of cigarettes and takes off his gloves in order to light one with a matchstick. He finds a crying baby lying on the floor and picks the baby up. He runs towards a trolley where he sees another baby and tells the mother of the second baby that the she dropped her other baby, but she scolds him  and he takes the baby and goes away. He is proceeding to leave the baby where he found it but a police officer comes by and he is forced to take back the baby. He founds a man with a limp and drops the baby on that man's arms and runs away. The man chases after him and he hides, so the man drops the baby in the previous trolley again and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the trolley, the mom sees him and chases him while scolding him so he picks up the baby and take it out of the trolley. The police officer is nearby so Chaplin feels responsible for picking up the baby and after walking with it in his arms, he sits down next to a sewer and opens it while contemplating the option of throwing the baby down, but soon after he discovers a letter which was wrapped in the baby's blanket which says something along the lines \"please take good care of me\", so he smiles at that and decides to keep the baby. this video, Charles Chaplin is walking by the street when he suddenly finds a small baby, who has apparently been abandoned in the street. Chaplin tries to find the baby's mother, and so he lefts the child to a woman who is passing by, but she hits him and gives the baby in return. Charles realises he can't lay the baby back where he found it, as a police guard is watching over him. He also tries to give the creature to another man but is given the baby in return once again. Finally, our main character sits down in the street and finds a note within the baby's clothes saying: \"please love and care for this orphan child\", and so Chaplin walks along with the baby in his arms. At the beginning of the video, Charles Chaplin is walking and stops to smoke a cigarette when he finds a child in the floor. He believes this child belongs to a woman who walks by him with another child but she is not the child's mother. Confused, Charles returns the baby to the spot where he found him but a policeman sees him so Charles decides to take the baby again. He tricks one man giving him the baby and runs away. Then, this man does the same and gives the baby to the woman that appeared before with another child and he runs away too. Suddenly, Charles appears in the same street where this woman is and she starts beating Charles until the policeman arrives again. Charles then decides to keep the baby and sits down when he finds a paper sticked to the baby's clothes saying to care and love the orphan child, which makes Charles keep the baby in the end. While Charles Chaplin was walking on the street, he decided to prepare a cigarette. While he was doing so, he saw a baby wrapped in blankets lying nearby. He picked up the baby and started looking around looking for his parents. He saw a woman walking by with a baby cart and thought that the baby was probably hers. As soon as he placed the baby in the cart, the woman started yelling at and hitting him because it wasn't hers. Then, Chaplin decided to leave again the baby where he had found it but a policeman saw it and Chaplin picked the baby up again. Afterwards, he made a man sustain it while he supposedly tie up his shoes and ran away. The man encountered the woman at the beginning of the story, placed the baby in the cart and ran away.  A bit later, the woman discovered the baby again in the cart and as she saw Chaplin walking nearby called the police and explained the situation. Chaplin picked up the baby again and after walking some time he sat down on the street thinking what he should do with the baby now. In that moment, he found a little note between the blankets that said that the baby was an orphan and asked whoever founded the baby to take care of him. After that, Chaplin smiled and decided to adopt him. During his stroll, Chaplin is assaulted by someone’s rubbish being thrown over a ledge, he lights a cigarette and then finds a baby in a corner. He seems to be abandoned but when a woman passes with a pram he assumes the baby must be her’s and puts him in the pram. He attempts to leave the baby twice after this and when the baby winds up in the same pram Chaplin is given the baby again. He considers abandoning the baby in the sewer but then finds a note. The baby is an orphan and Chaplin takes him in. Chaplin is walking down the street when he notices that there are some stones falling from the buildings around him. His cigarette is extinguished from one of these episodes, so he gets another cigarette from his pocket. He lights it and continues walking, but he suddenly hears a baby crying. The baby is lying on the ground, so Chaplin takes it. He looks for the person who might have left the baby there, but since he cannot see anybody else, he leaves the baby in a buggy. However, the woman who owns it sees Chaplin leaving the baby there and starts yelling at him. Chaplin takes the baby from the buggy and starts wondering again. He was going to put the baby back where he found it when a police officer came by and ordered him to keep the baby. Chaplin started walking with the baby when he saw an old man, to whom he tricked to get rid of the baby. Chaplin ran off to hide somewhere. In the meanwhile, the old man left the baby in the buggy where Chaplin had first left the baby. The woman did not see this old man leaving the baby in her buggy, so, later, when she saw Chaplin again, she blamed him. The police officer was around, and she told him about what she thought Chaplin had done. The police officer told him off and obliged him to take the baby with him. Chaplin, hopeless, sat down on the street. He was staring at the baby when he found a note wrapped in the baby's clothes, which said that the baby was an orphan, and asked the person reading it to love and take care or it. Chaplin smiled, stood up and left the scene with the baby. The video portrays the humorous adventures of a man (Chaplin) who accidentally gets himself in very problematic situations. At the beginning of the video, Chaplin leaves a building, and not far from there, he has a little accident with what it seems to be ruins of a construction. Later, this man decides to smoke a cigarette, and so he takes one from a box from inside his coat and lights the cigarette with his shoe. When he starts walking again, he finds a little baby on the corner of the street. He decides to pick up the baby and put it inside a chariot he finds not far from there. When the woman returns and finds out someone has put a baby inside, she immediately starts to what it seems shouting at Chaplin. Then, this man takes back the baby he had found and tries to put it back where he was. However, a police officer appears on the scene, so again, Chaplin picks up the baby, and this time he gives it to another man. This new man takes the baby, and he find the chariot of the previous scene and tries the same thing Chaplin had done. The man leaves the scene and when the woman finds out about the baby, Chaplin happens to be walking passed her, and so he's blamed for this action. The protagonist decides to take the baby with him and sits on the boarder of the pavement considering to put the baby inside the sewer but this only lasts for a few seconds in his mind. At the end of the video Chaplin finds what it seems to be a note from the baby's parent asking for someone to take care of this child. The man then smiles and keeps the baby with him. Chaplin finds a baby in the street, so he picks him up and places him in the cradle of the first woman he sees. However, this does not turn out well and she starts shouting at him, so he takes the child and leaves. After this, he decides to leave the baby where he found him, but there is a police man watching, making him leave and take the child with him. Consequently, he asks a man to hold the child while he ties the laces of his shoes, but this is just an excuse to run away and leave him the baby. This man places the baby in the same cradle that Chaplin left him before, but when the woman comes out of the shop she finds Chaplin and hits him with an umbrella. Therefore, Chaplin takes the baby again and leaves. He finds a note between the baby's clothes, saying that whoever finds him should love and take care of him and this is what he ends up doing.

Finally, he decides to keep the baby because he was an orphan The previous video tells the story of a man( Chaplin) who suddenly finds a baby on the street. At first, he thinks someone left him there so he starts looking around to see if he can guess where  the baby belongs. Later on, he sees a woman pushing a stroller and he tries to put the baby inside, although the woman does not let him do it.  As he cannot find the right place for the baby, he then decides to leave the baby where he found it, laying on the floor. Sadly for him, a policeman catches him red handed, which means he has to keep the baby again. Afterwards, he tricks a lame into holding the baby so that he can run away. The poor lame finds himself with a baby and, not knowing what to do, he leaves the baby in a stroller, which happens to be the same stroller as before. When the woman finds two babies in her stroller, she thinks Chaplin is to blame for abandoning the child and beats him up for this reason. After all this awful series of events, he finds a note in between the baby's clothes saying that he is an orphan. It is only now that Chaplin decides to keep the baby. The video opens with the image of Charles Chaplin walking in the street as he is smoking a cigar. Then, someone appears in a window and throws the trash through it. Chaplin continues walking and some trash falls upon him. For that, Chaplin insults the person and continues with his journey. He opens a silver cage where he stores a couple of cigars. Then, he grabs one and he lights it. He suddenly hears a cry and realizes that there is a baby on the floor. As he approaches the baby, a mum appears pushing a baby carriage. He grabs the baby and runs towards her to leave the infant inside it. Yet, the mum tells him that the baby is not hers and leaves with her real baby. Chaplin wonders whose baby is the one he has found, so he decides to leave the baby where he found it. In this moment, a police officer appears and a scared Chaplin takes the baby again and leaves the scene. In another street, Chaplin finds the opportunity of getting rid of the baby and, discreetly, he gives the baby to a man and runs away. The man pursues him and finds the baby carriage that appeared early on, so he decides to leave the baby there. The mum leaves the store where she was and finds the baby inside the carriage. In this moment, Chaplin appears on scene again and she runs towards him angrily to tell him to pick the baby. The police officer appears again and, in order to avoid reprisal, Chaplin grabs the baby and leaves again. Unsure about what to do, Charles sits on a kerb and  cares the baby. He finds a note wrapped with the blankets which says that this baby is an orphan and needs someone who cares for it. Finally, he decides to take the baby with him. At first, the main character walks out of a building and some dust is thrown onto him by a woman cleaning from the first floor. He starts smoking and some bricks are thrown at him. Therefore, the cigar he was smoking is useless now, so he takes a new one out of a box he's carrying. Just after he gets rid of his gloves, he notices an abandoned child laying on the pavement. He grabs the baby and spots a woman carrying a baby cart, which he follows right after. He places the baby inside, but after being told off by the woman, he takes the baby and walks away. He gives the baby to a passer-by, who is shocked. Then, he puts the baby in the trolley of the woman from before. The main character walks happily now, but the woman runs into him and starts hitting him because she thinks he has placed the baby in there.  In the middle of the argument, a police officer shows up wondering what the fight is all about. In order to avoid trouble, the man from the beginning keeps the baby. He seems not to know what to do next because he clearly does not want to keep it. He then realises there is a note inside the baby's clothing, remarking that it is a orphan child who needs to be looked after. His feelings change and now he happily walks away with the baby. This scene features Charles Chaplin, a famous English comic actor and filmmaker. The main character of the scene finds an abandoned baby in what appears to be a dilapidated building. While questioning how the baby got there, the character finds a woman who is pushing a baby carriage. The man accuses the woman of abandoning the child –since he uses the verb “drop”– but the woman denies the accusation and refuses to take care of the baby. The main protagonist tries to find an alternative way to get rid of the baby, and tricks an unknown man. After a series of events (that unknown man leaves the baby in the woman’s baby carriage, the woman accuses Chaplin of trying to abandon the child, and a police office is closely keeping an eye on him), the character gives up and sits on the kerb. At the end of the scene, he realises there is a letter inside the child’s clothes, in which it is stated that the baby is an orphan. After reading the letter, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby. Charles Chaplin wanders around the street among buildings under construction. Some bricks fall over him twice. He stops to smoke and throws away his gloves. He then finds a baby on the street and he thinks that it fell from one of the buildings. He takes him. Then, a woman walks near them with a baby in a buggy and he looks at her. Chaplin goes towards her and, when she is not looking, he leaves the baby in her buggy. She comes back and gets very angry: she shouts at him and he leaves with the baby. He thus leaves the baby where he found it initially but, as he turns back, there is a policeman looking at him. He takes the baby again and leaves. After turning round the corner, he gives the baby to a man on the street, pretending that he is just going to tie his shoelaces. He runs away while the man with the baby follows him. The man then leaves the baby in the buggy in which Chaplin had tried to leave the baby before. While running away from the policeman, Chaplin passes near the buggy and the woman sees him and hits him with her umbrella. They argue and, as the policeman comes, he has to take the baby again. They sit on the pavement and he thinks about leaving the baby in the sewer, but he finds a note in the baby’s clothes that say “please love and care for this orphan child”. He smiles and happily takes the baby with him.\n",

The old man, confused, keeps walking forward in the street and finds the trolley of the previous woman, leaving the baby there. When the woman finds the baby that she already gave back to Chaplin before in the trolley gets angry. In that moment, the protagonist passes by and the woman hits him in the head with an umbrella, as a signal of anger. When they came back to the trolley, Chaplin finds the baby again and has to pick him again afraid that the police officer doesn't arrest him. Tired, he sits in the pavement, wondering what to do with the baby. But then, inside the clothes the baby had, he finds a note, which has something written down in it: \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". As he finishes reading this, he decides to keep the baby with him. Charlie Chaplin finds an abandoned child next to a trash can and at first he thinks it belongs to a woman pushing a stroller who just happened to be walking around. The woman tells him the baby is not hers but he insists and even puts it in the stroller making the woman angry. He is then forced to take the baby away and it seems he wants to leave it where he found it. Right after he turns away from the baby he sees a police officer facing him and in order not to be, I would say, arrested; he takes it with him once again. Charlie then finds a note in the clothes that the baby is wrapped with saying it is an orphan and asks the person who reads the note to love and take care of him, making the baby his responsibility. Once upon a time, Chaplin was walking down a dirty and neglected street.\n",
      "He was clumsy, therefore, he banged into everything he came across. He started smoking right there, since he became overwhelmed by the situation.\n",
      "Suddenly, he found an abandoned baby. He picked up the baby and tried to put him into a baby carriage which belonged to a lady. She realized and they had a quarrel.\n",
      "Chaplin tried to put him back where he was found, but a policeman thought he (a father) was trying to abandon his son, hence, he had to look for a different place for the child. After a little while, he found an old man who was unable to walk well due to his disability. Chaplin gave him the child and ran away. The old man could do nothing about it. However, he found the same baby carriage, so he put him into the carriage. The lady, who was shopping, thought that Chaplin was the real guilty guy who placed the baby inside, so they fought and she told the policeman what the situation was about. Therefore, Chaplin had to take care of the baby, since he was not able to throw the baby into the sewer that he found. Finally, he found out that the baby was carrying a note under his blanket. The baby was orphan. Thus, Chaplin decided to keep the baby. Chaplin is walking down the street while some neighbours are throwing rubish through the window so it drops on him twice. Then he takes a cigarette out of a box and lights it with a match. After that, he finds a baby alone and picks him up. He sees a woman pushing a pram who seems to be looking for something, so he leaves the baby in the pram when the woman is not looking. She notices and tells him not to leave the baby there as it is not hers. He considers to leave it where he found it but a policeman appears, therefore he can't. He keeps on walking and sees another man, who is asked to hold the baby for a moment and then Chaplin runs away. This man carries the baby and sees the same woman with the pram and he leaves the baby in there again and walks away. When the woman notices, Chaplin passes her by chance and she blames him. The policeman appears again so Chaplin has to take the baby again. Finally, he sits on the pavement and, considering what to do with the baby, he finds a note asking to love and care the orphan child, so he decides to keep it. We find Chaplin's character walking on a desolated street. People are throwing garbage from their windows onto the streets. Part of this waste falls on top of Chaplin putting out the cigarette he was smoking.  \n",
      "Chaplin takes out his cigar case from his jacket, where we can see several half-smoked cigars and cigarettes. After lighting up one of these cigarettes, he realizes that there is a baby wrapped in a blanket lying on the floor right next to the garbage. \n",
      "Looking worried, Chaplin looks around for someone to give the baby to. He wants to give the baby to a woman that he sees on the street with a stroller but she refuses. He then, decides to leave the baby where he found it, but is spotted by a policeman and thus, has to take it back. After this, Chaplin, pretending to tie his shoe, hands the baby to a man who is walking down the street and runs off. This man in turn, leaves the baby again in the woman's stroller. \n",
      "The woman, seeing the baby and Chaplin again complains to the police and Chaplin finds himself again with the baby in his arms. Sitting down on the pavement cuddling the baby, he finally finds a note asking to love and care for the orphan and Chaplin keeps the baby. Chaplin is walking down the street when he suddenly finds a baby lying on the floor. He sees a woman with a baby carriage so he thinks the baby is hers, but when he puts the baby in the carriage, the woman starts to scream at him angrily, so he takes the baby again. Then he decides to let the baby lying on the floor where he has found it, but a policeman appears and Chaplin decides to take the baby again. He sees an old man then. He gives him the baby and he runs. The old man decides to put the baby in a carriage baby. This is the carriage baby of the same woman who screamed at Chaplin at the beginning!. Then she realizes that the wrong baby is again in her carriage and she sees Chaplin, she hits him with her umbrella and he takes the baby again. He is thinking about another idea when he finds a letter hidden in the clothes of the baby. In that letter, someone wrote that the child was an orphan and asked for love and care. Then, Chaplin decides to keep the baby and they both leave. Chaplin is going for a walk when suddenly he finds a baby abandoned by the side of the road. At first, he thinks someone might have dropped him by accident so he tries to return it to a woman passing by with her own baby, but she yells at him, probably because she believes he is trying to get rid of his baby. When Chaplin runs away from the angry mother, he puts the baby back when he found him; nevertheless, a policeman unexpectedly appears and he has to take the baby with him. However, he still tries to get rid of the poor creature by giving it to an old man and running away. The old man tries to chase him, but when he is unable to do so, he just tries to give the baby to someone else as well. He encounters the same mother Chaplin had already tried to give the baby to and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the woman and she realises the baby is there, she beats him up and screams at him violently. When the same policeman approaches to see what is happening, Chaplin just takes the baby again and goes away to avoid conflict. He seems to wonder what is he going to do with him when he realises there is a note between the clothes that wrap the child. In the note, the father or mother of the baby asks for whoever that encounters him, to please love and take care of him. Then, Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. We are introduced to a very awkward man, who narrowly avoids being hit in the head with rubble several times. When he gets to an alley and lits a cigarette, he finds a child, very little and wrapped in a scarf, in the dirt pavement. Apparently by chance, a woman passes by with a baby trolley and the man, thinking the woman dropped the child unintentionally, places the baby in the carrier. The woman gets really mad that he has tried to place an unknown child with hers and forces him to take it back. After many unsuccessful attempts at getting rid of the baby, the man finds a handwritten letter pleading with whoever found it to care for the child. The man ultimately heeds this, and we are led to believe he does so. Chaplin is walking along the street. People are throwing out the trash from their houses. Some of the trash fell on Chaplin, and he burns out a new cigarette. Then, he notices that there is a baby on the floor. He thinks a woman with another baby has lost this one, but it seems the baby is not hers. Chaplin gives the baby to a man, and this man leaves the baby in the previous woman's baby carriage, and fled away. The woman sees again Chaplin and makes him take the baby in front of a policeman. The baby has a letter in his clothes which says that he is orphan, and please to love and care him. Eventually, Chaplin keeps the baby. A man is walking in a poor neighbourhood when he finds a baby in the street. At first, he looks at the near buildings trying to find someone who could have forgot the child without success. Then, he picks him up and, thinking he might be the child of a lady that walks by at that precise moment, he tries to get the baby back to her. He puts the baby in the stroller, next to the other baby of the said lady, and she gets angry. She hits the man and apparently tells him the baby is not hers, so the man takes the baby back and tries to put him in the same spot where he founded him. This time, a policeman arrives and, thinking he may be abandoning that baby, gives the man a suspicious look. The man, alarmed, urgently picks up the baby again and takes him with him.\n",
      "Walking down the street, he tries to trick some other old man to pick up the baby and, without hesitating, he runs away. The old man, trying to find the man who tricked him, findsthe same lady that hit the man previously and leaves the baby in the stroller one more time and runs away.\n",
      "At the same time, the man who found the baby in the first place and then tricked someone to avoid keeping the baby, manages to run away safely. The only problem is that he meets the policeman again. To avoid suspicious situations one more time, he changes his path with so bad luck that he finds the lady that now is with an \"extra\" child. The lady bursts with anger and starts to hit the man so hard that he even ends up in the ground. The policeman arrives and the man has no choice rather than to pick the baby again.\n",
      "Devastated, he sits in the sidewalk with no more company than the baby. When he watches closely, he finds that the baby has a note in his clothes asking the one who finds the baby to give him love and care, for he is an orphan. The man, now motivated by the note, changes his face expression indicating that he may want to keep the child and perhaps raise him, and that he would give him the love and care the note asked for. Charles Chaplin found a baby in the street and did not know what to do with it. He tried to give it to different strangers, but no one wanted to keep it. He first tried to give it to a mother with a stroller, but the woman was upset and forced him to take back the child. Next, he tried to trick a man in the street by tieing his shoes and having him hold the baby. Chaplin ran away and the stranger saw the woman with the stroller and dropped off the baby there. The woman saw the baby then saw Chaplin walking around and chased him and gave the baby back. Chaplin was conflicted because he did not know how to properly dispose of the child. Towards the end, he read a letter notifying him that the baby was an orphan and decided to keep it. Chaplin, elegantly dressed and with a cane, is walking down the alleyway while they are revovating a flat. While he passes another street, trash falls on him from a window. Then, he stops and takes out his cigarette packet. He chooses on and after putting it in his mouth, he takes off his gloves little by little and lights the cigarette with a match, which he lights on the sole of his show and throws it in the bin. Suddenly, he sees a baby on the floor next to the trash. Chaplin look up to see if someone has thrown the baby out the window and pick him up. He sees a woman with a baby stroller and follows her. The woman leaves the stroller alone for a second and he places the baby in it. When she returns, he tell her that she dropped something  and points to the baby. The angry womman tell him that it is not hers and that he should take the baby. Charles Chaplin tries to put the baby where it was but the policeman appears and sees him abandoning the baby. So, he picks up the baby. Walking down the street he meets and old man and tells him to take the baby because he has stepped on something. Thanks to this, he runs away.  The old man starts runs after him but he cannot see Charles. Thus, the old man sees the lady's stroller and puts the baby there. Charles Chaplin meets the policeman again when he comes out of his hiding place. Chaplin bumps into the woman and the lady hits him on the head with an umbrella because she has his baby in the stroller again. The policeman sees them arguing and tells Charles to take his baby. Chaplin sits down on a sidewalk. He looks into a sewer to see whether he can drop the baby there or not. Charles Chaplin touches the baby's face and the bairn bites his finger. After all this, Chaplin looks between the baby's clothes and finds a letter which asks for love and care for the baby. In the end, Chaplin stays with the baby and he walks happily. Charles is smoking while walking down an alley in what seems to be a lower-class neighbourhood. Everything is covered in dust and dirt and people are throwing their trash out of the window, and as it is to be expected, Charles gets bathed with one of these garbage rains. He looks up at the person in the window and screams some obscenities before taking a small box out of his blazer to get another cigarette since the one he was previously smoking fell off his mouth with the impact. Putting the box back in its original place and ungloving his hands, Charles takes a match out of his waistcoat pocket and lights it using the sole of his shoe and proceeds to start his cigarette, getting rid of his gloves and throwing them into a trash can near him right after. He's just dusted his hands and taken the first puff when he hears a noise. Looking down to his left he sees a baby wrapped in some thin sheets and blankets lying on the ground. Charles bents down and checks under covers to make sure it is in a baby and then looks around confusedly, trying to find someone, probably someone who could be this kid's parent. Seeing, there's no one, he picks it up, and that's when a woman with a stroller passes by. Charles calls her up but the woman doesn't hear him, so he walks after her. However, when he catches up and gets to the stroller, the woman is nowhere to be seen, so he does what he considers logical and puts the baby in it, next to the woman's kid. The woman reappears seconds after and Charles tells her \"she's dropped something\" and attempts to leave, but the woman won't let him. Gesticulating and making her anger very visible, she gets Charles to take the baby back into his arms, but not before he mistakenly tries to pick up the wrong kid, which only makes the woman more agitated. After the encounter both people go their separate ways, Charles going back to the corner where he found the baby with the intention of leaving him there, never realising he's being watched by a police officer that's standing right behind him. The baby barely gets the chance to touch the ground because, as soon as Charles turns around and sees the expression of the imposing officer, he quickly changes his mind and picks the baby back up, walking away from the officer immediately. Once he's far enough, Charles tries his luck again. Seeing an old man, he stops him and gets him to hold the baby with the excuse of needing to tied his shoes. Charles kneels down just long enough for the old man to believe the lie before he sets off running to go and hide. The old man goes in his search, but not being able to find him, decides to do what Charles had done earlier and puts the baby in the woman's stroller that is now next to a shoe store and runs away. The woman shows up a moment later and is looking at the two babies incredulously when she sees Charles, who's has left his hiding place, walk past her without a care. She runs after him and attacks him from behind with her big umbrella, tackling him down to the ground where she keeps hitting him. This diverts into a heated discussion that only finishes when the police officer reappears and both the woman and Charles leave with their respective babies. Charles then sits on the pavement, with the baby still in his arms, contemplating what to do next. A manhole cover next to him catches then his attention.  He lifts it up, briefly considering whether he could do what he's thinking of doing, but then disregards the idea within a second. It's then, looking at the baby, that he realises there's a note stuck to its clothes, a note which reads \"Please, love and care for this orphan kid\". Charles doesn't have the heart to get rid of the kid after that. He looks down at the kid and smiles. Taking the walking stick he had laid next to him on the pavement, he gets up and leaves, holding the baby protectively against his chest. The video starts with Chaplin walking through a sloppy street, where rubbish is thrown at him from a window, after he cleans himself and fire a new cigarette Chaplin notices a baby next to a rubbish bin. In the moment he takes the baby from the floor he sees a lady with a buggy behind him, so he thinks that the lady might have lost the baby. He walks towards the buggy and place the baby inside while the woman is inside the building. When the woman leaves the building she reacts like that baby is not her kid and she asks (or probably imposes) Chaplin to pick the kid and leave, at first Chaplin attempts to take the other baby but she indicates that the baby he was trying to take wasnt the one he had put in the buggy before, then he picks up the right baby. Chaplin walks away with the baby and tries to leave the baby where he found it, next to the rubbish, but a police officer appears and Chaplin takes the baby back. In the next scene, Chaplin asks another gentleman to hold the baby while he pretends to tie his shoes, when Chaplin has the chance he runs away and hide. The gentleman tries to follow him but he can't find Chaplin, however he finds the lady's buggy and place the baby in it, one more time. When the woman sees the baby again she starts looking across the street and when she sees Chaplin she hits him with her umbrella, they start arguing because none of them want to take the baby, the police officer appears again and Chaplin, scared of the officer, take the baby and goes away. In the last scene, Chaplin seats on the edge of the pavement, next to a drain, Chaplin opens the drain, with the idea of throwing the baby inside it, but he doesn't do it. Finally, Chaplin finds a note inside the baby's clothes saying that the baby is an orphan and asking to the person who finds the note to take care and love the child. At the beginning of the video, we can se Charles Chaplin in the background walking towards the foreground. While he is walking and smoking, somebody is throwing debris to the street from a window. \n",
      "He keeps walking. Then, near some rubbish bins, some rubbish falls on him from above. He looks up to see who did that and retrieves a metal box from his jacket pocket. Inside, cigars and cigarettes can be found. He takes a cigarette and removes his gloves; after that, he lights a match in his right sole to light his cigarette. Then, he throws his gloves away and looks to his left. There, next to the rubbish bins, a baby, wrapped in blankets, lies on the floor. \n",
      "He touches the baby carefully and looks around as if trying to find whose baby this is. Since he finds nobody, he holds the baby. While he is trying to find its parents, a woman pulling a baby stroller appears in the background. He calls her and runs towards her. And, immediately after reaching her, he places the baby in the stroller, where there is already another baby. The woman, surprised, starts yelling at him and tells him to hold the baby again, as it is assumed it is not hers. He obeys, but almost takes the wrong baby. Finally, he retrieves the right baby from the stroller and runs away from the woman. \n",
      "He goes back to the corner where he found the baby and puts it in the same place. A police officer appears. He blows a kiss to the baby but after seeing the police officer he takes the baby again. \n",
      "He starts walking and sees another man, with a cane, on his way. He asks him to hold the baby while he cleans his shoes as he stepped into a muddy puddle. Once the stranger is holding the baby, Chaplin runs away. The stranger follows him as fast as he can, but Chaplin finds a place with a door open and hides there. In his search, the stranger finds the abovementioned stroller and, since nobody is watching it, he puts the baby inside and runs. When Chaplin leaves his secret place he finds the police officer on his way so he starts walking fast in the opposite direction. Then, the previous woman returns to her stroller and finds two babies instead of one. So, when Chaplin passes by them, she calls him in the middle of the street. However, he pretends not to have heard anything and keeps walking. So she starts running after him and hits his head with her umbrella until he is lying on the floor. She grabs him and takes him with her until they both reach the stroller. Then, she warns him to take the baby. In fact, as the police officers passes by, she calls him to inform about their situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and everybody resumes their way. \n",
      "After a few steps, Chaplin drops his cane by a sewer. So he sits down to retrieve it and lifts the top of the sewer thinking about putting the baby there. Nevertheless, he thinks twice and rejects this idea. While he is figuring out how to hold the baby and his cane at the same time, he finds a letter between the baby's blankets indicating to love and care for that orphan child. After reading it, Chaplin feels sorry for the baby, keeps the letter in his inner pocket and smiles at the baby. He stands up and eventually takes the baby with him. Chaplin's character is seen walking out of a building which is in ruins, smoking and walking into an alley which is just as ruined. He is thrown trash from above him, and after that he opens up a small metal box containing cigars, he takes one and lights it to smoke it. Next to where he is standing, he finds a baby and assumes he/she is the child of a lady who's walking in the alley as well, pushing a baby stroller with another baby in it. The main character approaches her and gives her the baby, but the child is not hers so the protagonist leaves the baby where he found it. Just as he is doing that, a police officer shows up and gives him a judgemental look, making the protagonist take the baby again. He then finds an old man and gives the baby to him before running away. This old man leaves the baby in the stroller of the lady when she is not looking and runs away. While he does that, Chaplin's character encounters the police officer again and runs away from him. He is caught by the woman, who assumes he was the one to put the baby in the stroller and she follows him to beat him. The same police officer appears again and the woman explains the situation to him, which leaves no choice for the protagonist other than to take the baby. He is desperate and even considers putting the baby in a sewer, but finds a note attached to him/her that says: \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". This ultimately convinces him to 'adopt' the baby. A man is walking down a street; he wears a suit, a hat and a cane, but his appearance is quite untidy, as his clothes are all shabby. Someone, probably some workers, is throwing rubble from the window of a building, which almost hits the man. He keeps walking, until another worker throws more rubble through another window; this time, the protagonist gets hit. He gets angry and insults the worker; he also realises he has lost his cigarette, so he picks another one from a metal case and lights it. He intends to keep walking, when he notices a little baby lying on the floor, wrapped up in a blanket and crying. The man looks around to see if the baby has fallen from a window, and he picks him up. Suddenly, he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy, with another kid in it. The man comes closer and leaves the baby inside the buggy, but the woman yells at him and tells him to take the baby out of the buggy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The man picks the baby and he intends to leave the kid where he was lying, but a policeman shows up, so the man has to pick him up again. He walks with the baby in his arms until he sees an old man walking down the street. He asks him to hold the baby with the excuse of tying up his shoelaces, but once he leaves the baby in the old man's arms, he runs away. The old man doesn't know what to do, but he sees a baby buggy on the street, so he leaves the baby in it. The same woman that appeared before comes out of a shop, and she gets very angry when she sees the baby in the buggy again. Suddenly, the protagonist of the video shows up, so she thinks he has left the baby there and runs after him to beat him with her umbrella. She forces him to take the baby, and when the policeman shows up again, she asks him for help, so the protagonist has to pick the baby up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man walks away from the street with the baby in his arms, until he sits on the pavement. He doesn't know what to do. He sees a drain next to the pavement; he opens it and looks at the baby, but he nods and closes the drain. He looks at the baby again, and he feels something in the blanket. He takes out a piece of paper, where he reads: \"please love and care of this orphan child\". The protagonist feels moved by the letter; now his feelings towards the baby have changed. He stands up and walks away, taking the baby with him. Chaplin was walking down the street while smoking but people kept throwing stuff that looks as if it were construction materials from their houses' windows that happened to hit him. He lighted another cigarette and found a baby on the street. But soon realized that a woman was pushing a baby chair with no baby in it and decided to put the baby where it should have been. However, there was a baby in that woman's chair so he decided to put the baby back where he found it, but a policeman appeared suddenly so he took the baby again and gave it to a man before running away. This man left the baby in the woman's baby chair again, but Chaplin was walking there and the woman thought it was him again, so she hits him with her umbrella. Chaplin takes the baby. He finds a note inside the baby's blankets and decides to keep him. In this video, we can see an extract from the silent movie \"The Kid\" starring by Charles Chaplin. In this scene, Charles Chaplin has found an orphan baby. Firstly, he didn't want  the responsibility of caring him and he tried to get rid of that baby. Unfortunately, he didn't success but he got attached to him and tried to become softer. Finally, he decided to take on this baby. They look adorable when they are together. We see Charlie Chaplin walking through a rough neighborhood when he discovers a baby amongst the trashcans. He then proceeds to give it to a woman with a baby stroller. When she angrily tells him that the baby is not hers, Charlie tries to put the baby back where he found it. After a series of misunderstandings that includes an altercation with a policeman, he realizes (via a note found inside the baby's blanket) that the kid is an orphan. At the end, he decides to care for the infant. The story starts with the tramp roaming through a street surrounded by decaying buildings. As he walks past the buildings, some of the people inside throw rubbish out the windows, hitting the tramp. When he reaches the foreground, and after cursing the last person who's thrown his or her rubbish on him, he searches for his cigarette box in his jacket pockets. There are only butts in his box, but he lights one and smokes. He removes his mittens in the process to do it more easily, but then decides to just throw them away instead of putting them back on or in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that precise moment he hears a baby crying next to him, and finds him on the ground, wrapped in some blankets, by a rubbish can. The tramp looks up, thinking that maybe someone has thrown the baby away through the window with the trash. He lifts the infant. Behind him a lady passes with a pushchair. The tramp sees her and walks up to her to give her the child--\"Excuse me, you've dropped something\"--says the tramp to her. If he is either innocently trying to return the baby to his mother, or cunningly trying to get rid of the child, we are not told; his attitude is ambiguous. The tramp then tries to leave the baby in the pushchair. The lady, outraged by what she perceives as the tramp's knavery,  rebukes him severely and forces him to take the baby back with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Charlot is about to leave the child back where he found him, a policeman catches him red-handed, so he sees himself in the obligation to take the baby with him again. After that, he comes across a bearded hobo, and pretends he has to do his shoelace to ask him to hold the baby for a second, taking advantage of this to escape without the baby. He runs off and hides; the bearded vagabond looks for him, but, unable to find Charlot, he tries to leave the baby in a pushchair he sees at the door of a shoe-shop. He walks off. Charlot gets out of his hideout, but stumbles upon the police officer, which makes him turn around and take the opposite direction. The lady he encountered before steps out of the shop where the pushchair was, and just at that moment he passes by. This coincidence makes the lady think it is him again who has tried to sneak another baby in her pushchair. This time the furious lady beats the tramp violently with her umbrella. The policeman arrives while they are quarreling, and in consequence the tramp has no choice but to take the baby again with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he wanders along the sidewalk with the child in his arms, the tramp drops his cane stick. He sits on the curb, picks up his stick and suddenly notices the gutter. He considers for a dramatic moment to throw the baby down the gutter, but discards the brutish option. He begins examining the child, who bits his finger. Thus, he finds a piece of paper among the baby's clothes, with a message written on it: \"Please love and care for this orphan child\". This message at last convinces him to take responsability. He smiles at the baby, gets up and walks off with him. He is walking in the street and someone is throwing something out the\n",
      " window. Another persson is throwing rubbish and it hits him. After that he takes a cigarette and he starts smoking. He finds a baby who is crying and he starts looking in every direction to see if he finds someone. He sees a woman with another baby and he thinks the baby is hers and he tells her: 'Pardon me, you dropped something.' The woman seems to be saying the baby is not hers and he takes the baby back again and when he is going to put him/her where he found her/him a police man sees him abandoning the baby so he picks the baby up again. He gives the baby to a man in the street while he pretends to tie his shoelaces and then he run away. The man follows him and when he does not find him the man decides to put the baby in the stroller again. The woman comes back to the stroller and she finds a second baby again but in that moment Chapling is walking next to her so she starts hitting him with an umbrella. The polices man appears again and the woman seems to be telling him that Chaplin was abandoning the baby so he takes it back. Chaplin finds a note which says to take care of the orphan baby. In this black-and-white video, it can be seen Charles Chaplin in one of his silent films. In the first scene of the video, Chaplin is in the middle of an alley, where people are throwing away what seems to be rubble and dirt until one person throws rubbish upon him. In a close-up image of Chaplin, we can see he is wearing mittens and grab a cigarette just before seeing a baby abandoned in the middle of the alley. As he does not know what to do with this child, he tries to get rid of him in different ways. First, he tries to get the baby in a lady’s baby pushchair, with another baby in it. He is caught, so he tries to leave the baby in the same place he found it, being caught again by a police officer. In his third attempt, he manages to do get rid of the baby, leaving him with a bearded man. However, eventually, the baby ends up again in the lady’s pushchair and as she recognises Chaplin, she told him off and calls the same police officer that was patrolling there. Finally, Chaplin, just when he is about to leave the kid in the sewage system, finds a note, in which someone wrote that this kid is an orphan and requests that whoever has found him to take care of him. This final letter seems to be the conclusive reason for Chaplin to adopt the child. While walking on the street, Charles Chaplin finds a baby on the ground. He tries to give it back to its mother, and get rid of it by leaving it where it was found and passing it to another man, but eventually the baby is given back to him and he finds himself stuck with it. Finally, Chaplin finds a note hidden in the baby's blankets saying that the baby needs someone to love it and care for it. The tramp is walking around an area of abandoned buildings where some construction or demolishing is going on so debris falls around him several times until some hits him. He stops, brushes off the dust and takes out a cigarrette tin. The tramp takes off his  worn off gloves, of which most fingers are missing, and carefully selects a cigarrette stub from an assortment of cigarrette and cigar ends, lights it striking a match on his sole. He throws away the match into a bin and then throws the gloves too. After walkin on a few steps, he finds a little  baby lying on the floor, picks it up and looks up as if the baby could have fallen off a window. The tramp turns around and sees a woman pushing a big perambulator carrying one baby, he imagines she dropped the baby he found and puts it inside the perambulator but the woman complains, so he takes the baby again and puts it carefully where he found it but as he's about to leave the baby a policeman arrives so The tramp turns immediately, picks up the baby again and goes away.\n",
      "While The tramp is carrying the baby, he walks by a passer-by, pretends to have to tie his shoelace and ask the unknown to hold the baby but as soon as the passer-by has the baby in his hands, the tramp runs away. The unknown sees a perambulator outside a shop, puts the baby inside and leaves. As The tramp is walking by, the mother and owner of the perambulator comes out of the shop, discovers the second baby and guesses the Tramp has done it again. She chases him and hits him with her umbrella back to the perambulator. When they are discussing about the baby the same cop arrives again and The tramp takes the baby and leaves. He sits on the curb and considers throwing the baby into the sewer but on second thoughts he doesn't and pets it. Something pricks his finger and he finds a note saying please love and care this orphan child. He decides to do it. Charles Chaplin is walking down a narrow and dilapidated street. He is struggling to avoid the rubble while smoking a cigar when he suddenly sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks it up and brings it to a woman carrying a pram, who refuses to take him though. Back with the baby, Chaplin gives the kid this time to an old man, trying to avoid the policeman who is following him. However, the old man puts the baby again in the pram of the woman, making her mad. Chaplin has no option but to take the kid and leave. He finally ends pitying the baby and taking care of him. From afar comes a man, actually, he is Charles Chaplin, he wears a scruffy suit, a hat and big shoes. This bizarre outfit gives him a funny air. He has a cigarette between his lips and when he blows the smoke comes as if he was a steam locomotive. He walks like nothing around him matters, like he is oblivious of his surrounding. He passes below an open window, from which a man appears and throw something white, perhaps dust or flour, who knows. Mr. Chaplin looks at the fallen thing just for a second and continues with his walk in that clumsy way he has. He approaches and gets closer and closer. And while he walks, he changes the cane he is holding from one hand to another and plays with it and bends it. Suddenly, something from above falls on his head and this time it really bothers him. He looks up and down trying to find from where that thing comes. Then, from his pocket he gets a tin, a tobacco tin, he opens it and take one cigarette. Then, he takes the tin back to his pocket and after removing his gloves he lights the cigarette and starts smoking again. He gets rid of the gloves by throwing them into a bin and when he looks at his right he finds a baby crying wrapped up in a blanket. He looks everywhere trying to find his parents. “Where this baby comes from?”, he seems to wonder. He takes the baby in his arms and in the distance he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy. Thinking that perhaps she is the baby’s mother, Mr. Chaplin puts the baby inside the buggy. When the women finds out, she starts yelling at him and he can do nothing but to take the baby away and retrieve the poor thing to his or her original place. However, a policeman just appears from nowhere and looks at him in an earnest way that makes Mr. Chaplin take the baby again in a rush and leave. Afterwards, he finds an old man walking in a cane; he gives the baby to him and flees. The old man goes after him but Mr. Chaplin hides away. In his way, trying to find Mr. Chaplin, the old man just by chance finds the baby baggy mentioned above and leaves the baby inside it and runs away. When the woman finds out that there was an “intruder”, she gets really crossed. The funny thing is that Mr. Chaplin walks in front of her own eyes, so the women goes after him shouting and raising her umbrella and pointing it at him. She starts striking him repeatedly, shouting at him and demanding an explanation. The policeman appears and approaches since these two are enrolled in an argument, the woman explains what has just happened and Mr. Chaplin just takes the baby away once again. He seats down and next to him finds a gutter and opens it. For just a moment, he weights his possibilities. However, something happens: the baby carries a note which reads “Please, love and care for this orphan child”. Mr. Chaplin looks at the baby with compassion and kindness, takes him in his arms and without raising his eyes from him, leaves the scene. At first, we see Chaplin walking through the city until he stops to smoke a cigarette. He, then, founds a baby wrapped in a blanket but because he is unable to find the baby's parents, he tries putting it back where he found it. At the same time, a policeman appears and obviously thinks it is Chaplin who is abandoning the baby so he is forced to take it with him. He tricks a random man into holding the baby and then takes off. However, after turning a corner, he founds himself accused of abandoning the baby by a woman and ends up with the baby in his arms again. After all, it seems like Chaplin is destined to care for the baby and takes it with him. \n"
